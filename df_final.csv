What's her question for the President Kaitlan? Hello, President Chung. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. The current administration has made it clear that we should continue to provide military equipment to Ukraine so that they can defend themselves. Do you support this decision? And how would you deal with the increasing threat posed by Vladimir Putin? First of all, thank you very much. It's really nice and it's an important question so important because we're giving away so much equipment. We don't have ammunition for ourselves right now. We don't have ammunition for, we're giving away so much. But here's the thing I have to say it to start off no longer matters. If I were president, this would have never happened. And even the Democrats admit that Putin knew it would have never happened and his pipeline would have never happened. A lot of things would have never happened, but this would never happen. And all those dead people, both Russian and Ukrainian, they wouldn't be dead today and all those cities that have blown up and disintegrated. Right. To the ground that wouldn't have happened. Ok. Now, here's the problem we've given so far $171 billion they've given meaning, meaning European Union, which is approximately the same size altogether as our economy. They've given about 20. So we're at 170 let's say, and they're at 20 you don't have to know too much about history to realize or geography to realize that they're a little bit more effective than we are. Ok. So they've got to put up a lot more money because they're taking advantage of us like every other country. That's why I ended NAFTA and replaced it with the US MC Mexico on this issue, Mr President. I should know, I don't know any Democrats who have said they don't believe Putin would have invaded if you were president. But her question is, would you continue to give Ukraine money and weapons if you're elected? What's the answer? I have a very good relationship with President Zelinski because as you know, he backed me up with a phony impeachment, impeachment hoax. Number one when he said the president didn't do anything wrong. So I, I happen to like, that's right and I was totally exonerated by the way, just a waste of time and money. You were impeached. The question is Ukraine was by a crazy woman named Nancy. But the question here is, would you give Ukraine weapons and funding if you were? I would sit down. Let me just put it a nice way. If I'm President, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours. They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths and within 24 hours that war will be settled, it will be over. It will be. Absolutely. Do you want Ukraine to win this war? I don't think in terms of winning and losing, I think in terms of getting it settled. So we stop killing all these people and breaking down that you don't think in terms of follow up on that because that's a really important statement. Can you say if you want Ukraine or Russia to win this war? I want everybody to stop dying. They're dying. Russians and Ukrainians, I want them to stop and I'll have that done. I'll have that done in 24 hours. I'll have it done. You need the power of the presidency to do it, but you won't say that you want Ukraine to win you. You know what I'll say, I'll say this. I want Europe to put up more money because they're in for 20 billion. We're in for 170. And they should be, and they should equalize. They have plenty of money. They should equalize. I got with NATO when I sat down, I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars that they weren't paying under Obama and Bush and all of these other presidents. That's why they're able to help them fight the war because of the money I got. But I want you, I want Europe to put up more money because they're laughing at us. They think we're a bunch of jerks. We're spending $170 billion for far away land and they're right next door to that land and they're in for 20. I don't think so. When it comes to what's happened there, when you were in office, you said that you respected President Putin, do you still respect him today? He made a tremendous mistake. He made, he was a smart guy. You know, I remember I said he was smart. She was smart. They said he said President Xi of China, right is smart. OK? 1.5 billion people. He's the ruler of 1.5 billion people. I said he is a smart guy. How dare he say he's smart? Of course, he's smart. They want you to say he's a stupid person. Ok? He's not a stupid person. He's very smart, he's very cunning and Putin made a bad mistake. In my opinion, his mistake was going in. He would have never gone in. If I was president, we used to talk about it.

Just remember this is crooked Joe Biden's inflation and there's never been an inflation like it. It's the worst in 72 years. But I think it's much longer than that. Under my leadership, we had no inflation, it was virtually zero. Then crooked Joe came along and you had inflation at the highest level in 52 years.

It's a disaster and taxpayer funded benefits for hordes of illegal aliens.

It's a disgrace, but I will fix it and I will fix it fast. I will end Joe Biden's inflation nightmare once and for all. And we will quickly rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world.

You're gonna be very rich again. And that's the way we want it to be. Thank you very much. It's true. People can't afford anything.

A because the biggest lie that you've ever been told in your life is that it's actually fun to sleep with a random chick that you met at a party and b because under these new regulations, you are essentially now guilty until proven innocent. Now, I want to preface this by saying that of course not all accusations of essay are false when women come forward, they need to be taken seriously. Last time I checked, we still live in America and just because you are accused of something does not mean you are guilty of it. The standards for how S A is handled at universities were originally overhauled by the Obama administration. They created what is known as the single investigator model. The guidelines became that when a woman accuses a guy of sa a single college administrator now determines the outcome of the case. A K A, this random college administrator now can play judge jury in execution. Naturally, this led to several high profile instances of men being kicked out of their colleges and having their lives ruined due to a false accusation. I was also a first hand witness to this when I was a freshman at Sacred Heart University, a girl named Nikki Ivino accused two guys on the football team of raping her, but it later turned out that she made the entire thing up. She ended up going to jail for a year for this and received three years of probation after that. And even though that may seem like some semblance of justice, the damage to these two guys was already done. They lost their scholarships, they were forced to leave the school, they never played football again. Now when Trump came into office, his Department of Education under Betsy DeVos completely reversed the Obama era guidelines. The guidelines that they put in place gave people who were accused of sa the right to a live hearing where they could cross examine their accusers. They actually got some sort of a fair trial before a college administrator decided if they were guilty or innocent. But now under Biden and Cardona, the Kangaroo courts are back and not only are they back, their new regulations go even further than that under these new rules, schools are now required to use the preponderance of evidence standard. What this means that if just 51% of the evidence in a case points to their guilt, they're automatically guilty. Those accused are no longer are entitled to a guaranteed hearing to present their side of the story. And not only that schools are no longer required to provide accused students the full evidence that is being presented against them. So you're not allowed to present your side of the story. You're not allowed full access to the evidence being presented against you and one person at your college will decide if you're innocent or guilty. That is what will happen if you are accused of doing something wrong by a woman. This is not a joke, fellas, it's serious shit that could lead to your life being with all that being said, there's a very simple thing that can lead to this never happening to you. Stop banging random broads that you meet at parties. It may seem fun for the 1st 10 minutes or so. But then you eventually realize that you're in bed with a stranger. And it kind of sucks. You know, what's a lot more fun waking up next to somebody that you have a genuine connection with, taking somebody on a date, making them your girlfriend, knowing that you're already going home from the party with somebody you can trust. That's a lot more fun and we'll guarantee your safety from the Biden Kangaroo courts.""",14_mp4_trial_2.json,"If you are a guy who is a current college student or the parent of a guy currently in college, you need to watch this entire Tik Tok because the federal government just made it insanely easy for you or your son to have his life ruined by a mere accusation of wrongdoing.

If you're unaware of what this program is, this is where migrants who don't qualify for asylum or have criminal records in their country of origin or have been arrested after prior attempts to illegally enter our country. This is where by executive order of the president, those people not only get access to the US, but they actually get flown into the city of their choice and we find only have the records of where all these people are going and again, liberals, you can try to claim misinformation, but this is direct from the house subpoena. This was provided directly from the Department of Homeland Security. Here's the numbers according to customs and border patrol. Since the start of this program last year, more than 404,000 migrants have been flown into the US. Now remember these are migrants who don't qualify under any other program we have meaning that every one of these 404,000 migrants that have been flown into the US either has a criminal record in their country of origin. They don't qualify for asylum or they have been caught trying to illegally enter the US. Prior to this, this includes 154,000 Haitians, 95,000 Venezuelans, 84,000 Cubans and 69,000 Nicaraguans. Now, in case you were curious where all these migrants have been flown to take a look and see if your city is listed. I mean, it's very obvious these migrants love the beach. I mean, damn, think about how expensive a flight would be for any of us to any of these places, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, New York, Houston, Orlando L A, Tampa Dallas, San Fran.

But they pass a bill that allows the US government to spy on all Americans without a warrant. Makes sense to me. Not, they want us to be worried about this Tik Tok app where we unite and talk and discuss things instead of worrying about the US government. Does that make any sense to anyone? This government? I would take a mean tweet any time. Now, please come back now before I carry on. Has anybody else noticed and seen that the house when they passed the tiktok ban and the Ukraine package on the house floor, they were waving Ukraine flags. Ask yourself who does the US politicians work for Ukraine or US? Because while they're waving that Ukraine flag on the House of Representatives floor, guess what's not in that Ukraine package, any money that secures our border, not a fucking dime. But yeah, our US politicians are waving the Ukraine flag there on the house floor while they're selling out Americans and not securing us, $60.84 billion could have went to secure our southern border and some up to the northern border but not a dime, I guess American security isn't really important to our politicians.

But let's be real by every objective standard, Donald Trump is a way better father. Like this shit isn't even close. Let's look at Joe Biden as a father and a grandfather. So as a father, he's had three kids. Now his one daughter wonders in her diary whether or not she was molested, she says that she's aware she was definitely hyper sexualized and now she's hiding from public life, Tik Tok. You can't really argue any of that. She just acknowledged that it was her diary and those were her words in a letter to the judge and her job if you want to call it. That is that she's a social justice advocate. That's just a woke way of saying unemployed and living off daddy's money. Joe Biden had two sons. One of them seemed like a pretty good dude. He has since passed, but he served his country and by all accounts seemed like a good guy. The other one, aside from massive drug addiction, nearly uncountable amount of felony charges to include tax evasion, fraud and gun charges was also cheating on his wife by banging his dead brother's widow very shortly after his brother passed. Then when we look at Biden's grandkids, he says he loves all his grandchildren except for that one. Hunter recently had with a stripper. Now he's gone ahead and disowned that one. They paid them a good sum of money to never use the Biden name again. Then when we look over on Trump's side, every single one of his kids is massively successful in business. Like sure they got some help from daddy's money to start. So did guidance kids. When it comes to Trump's kids, there's no scandals, there's no drug addiction, there's no banging prostitutes and strippers. No, they're all married and successful and happy. Every fucking one of them.

It almost feels like Biden is trying to lose the election because along with this, he's also proposing a 25% tax on unrealized gains, which is fucking insane. But let me quickly explain why both of these things would be absolutely destructive to the US economy. So first off raising the capital gains tax to 44.6 percent, if you're unaware, capital gains are what you get from like selling a company selling a home, selling stocks. Basically, it's like other than normal income. And Biden wants to tax that at 44.6%. So in a market where people need homes, selling your home just became out of the question. There is no way you're going to financially benefit from selling your house because even if it did go up in value, you're paying 44.6 percent tax. Oh And if you're in California, you also have a 13.3% capital gains state tax, which means when you sell your home, you'd be paying almost a 58% tax on the profit. Do you understand how insane that is? Means when you sell your company, your house or your stocks out of every dollar, the government is going to get 60 fucking cents and you're going to get about 40. I don't know about you, but I do not think there is any point where the government should make more money from my labor than I do. And then let's talk about the fucking 25% tax on unrealized gains. Y'all understand what unrealized gains, right? Say you have a stock that's worth $100,000 and the value of that stock goes up to 200,000. But you don't sell it because it's a long term investment for you. You're like saving for retirement. There's a very good chance that the value of that stock could go down in the future. But it doesn't matter even though you didn't sell that stock. So you don't have that money. You got to come up with a $25,000 tax payment. You got to pay $25,000 on money. You didn't actually make, that's fucking stupid. But here's the thing, I totally get what Biden is trying to do. He's just doing it the wrong way. What he's trying to stop is these massive investors that have their portfolio increase in price, but they don't actually sell it. They just borrow against the value of it this way. They're basically getting the benefits of the value without actually having to sell it. The way you fix that is you don't let people borrow against the value. That's how you could deal with it. But taxing somebody on money that they haven't actually made is stupid. It's just one of the dumbest ideas I've ever heard because you haven't made the fucking money. Like I said before, this combined with banning tiktok, he's just trying to piss off every generation.

And this is also the same d over the last year has lowered half the felonies. He's prosecuted to misdemeanors. And then we got the judge, a judge who is not only a supporter of this person's opponent, but also supports that opponent financially through donations. And then you have the judge's daughter who actively works for Democrat fundraising campaigns, raising money for the opponent of Donald Trump daughter who has actually raised money and profited off this case already. And then you have the fucking gag orders where the d can go out and say whatever he wants to the American people, whatever he wants to potential jurors, whatever he wants to the media where his judge and his daughter can do the same.

By the way, this dude is on Tik Tok live every night begging people to pay attention to him. The entire case hinges on the word of a woman who already lost a defamation case against Trump owes him 300 grand and refuses to pay and a disgraced disbarred lawyer. And by the way, liberals, everything I just said is 100% fact, everything I just said is verifiably true. You cannot contradict any of that. Now, that we know that that's all true. How the fuck are we allowing this to happen? How are we allowing corn stars and disgraced lawyers to interfere with our election process? Are we allowing biased judges and daughters who are working for the other side? How are we allowing ad A to bring charges who literally campaigned on bringing charges against Donald Trump? How are we allowing all the people on one side to say whatever the fuck they want to, the media. Donald Trump and his lawyers can't say a damn thing. The best part is even with all this, Donald Trump is going to crush these people in November, you all have to honestly think about this for a second.

Today, the Republican presidential nominee wasn't campaigning for president. He was sitting in a courtroom courtroom that he is very likely going to have to sit in every single day for the next few months because the judge has required him to be there every day of the trial. He is being prosecuted by ad a who campaigned on indicting him, who made it one of his campaign promises to find something to charge Donald Trump with now that he found some bullshit to charge him with, he's prosecuting him. Oh, and the bullshit he found to charge him with was a misdemeanor that he has upgraded to a felony. Also happens to be the first time that misdemeanor has ever been upgraded to a felony. And this is also the same d over the last year has lowered half the felonies. He's prosecuted to misdemeanors. And then we got the judge, a judge who is not only a supporter of this person's opponent, but also supports that opponent financially through donations. And then you have the judge's daughter who actively works for Democrat fundraising campaigns, raising money for the opponent of Donald Trump daughter who has actually raised money and profited off this case already. And then you have the fucking gag orders where the d can go out and say whatever he wants to the American people, whatever he wants to potential jurors, whatever he wants to the media where his judge and his daughter can do the same. But Donald Trump and his lawyers can't say shit and the trial is not going to be televised is they feel it would give undue media coverage to Donald Trump, the person running for president who they're not letting campaign. And the funny thing is this whole case centers around the stormy Daniels bullshit. A woman who currently owes Donald Trump hundreds of thousands of dollars.

He still hasn't conceded the election which he plainly lost. He's charged with actual crimes, criminal intent to obscure uh to, to, to, I forget what the actual name of the, uh, law is. But criminal intent to basically steal the election or to coerce people in the states from, uh, I forget what it is.

He was putting forward the fake slate of electors. I mean, yes, he tried every possible way to steal this election. He tried to do it through the courts, he tried to do it through state legislatures. He tried to do it through intimidating Mike Pence. He tried to do it through the justice department. They talked about seizing voting machines, they talked about the using the army. I mean, you can't really believe that this guy is not worse than Joe Biden. I mean, I agree, Biden is not a great president and the Hunter Biden stuff is a stinky conspiracy, not a conspiracy, a stinky scandal that stinks to the high heavens.

Say all those things, but it still doesn't take away from the fact that there's something wrong with b like he makes up words, he stumbles through things. It seems like he doesn't know where he is. Half the time. He's very, very old. That's my problem with them. Well, again, we're living in a world where perfect is not on the menu. Trump looks a lot and sounds a lot more hearty and robust and healthy. That's true. He's a city roach. The worst things he eats the stronger he gets. You can, you cannot kill him. No, he's also the only guy that didn't noticeably age the moment he God, no, we did. We aged when he was in office. He was fine. You're right. He didn't look like he aged. He just, he always looks the same, but he's, but he's a criminal and he's crazy and he's stupid and crazy and stupid are two different things.

Stupid is like, uh Frederick Douglass is alive or the stealth bomber is literally invisible or nobody knew health care was hard to solve. That's just stupid. He's very stupid. Crazy is like, it's important that the crowd at my inauguration was the biggest ever.

I don't even know what they are and I don't care. And I'm going to put them next to the toilet at Mar A Lago and then I'm going to fight you to take them back or not conceding the election.

Do you even have a slight understanding of how much worse your life is about to get? I'm sure you saw the higher teacher pay in Chicago and you're like, oh, gotta go there. But did you think about this decision at all? Let me explain to you why your life is about to get worse and not just a little bit worse like your life is about to get worse in every way. Let's start at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs with safety. You recognize that violent crime in Chicago is 13 points higher than it is in Florida. Do you understand how much 13 points is when we're talking about violent crime? Not only is it 13 points higher than any city in Florida? It's also more than double the national average. So you're certainly going to be less safe. Now, let's talk about your paycheck. Sure, you are going to be making more money. But if you compare cost of living, you take into account the fact that you're going to be paying state taxes, which you weren't in Florida. And then you add in the more expensive housing costs, the more expensive food costs, generally just a much higher cost of living in Chicago. In comparison to Florida, you are essentially going to be taking a pay cut. You can't really debate that. That's just simple math. Oh, yeah. And you're also going to have higher sales tax, not only are you going to be paying more for everyday items, but you're going to be paying more in taxes too. Now, let's talk about weather. Florida's weather is notoriously awesome. Sure. It's a little hot but it's pretty fucking nice here. Chicago's weather on the other hand, is notoriously shit, like almost every bad weather condition you could ever have in a city. Chicago has our average temperature in January is 52 degrees. Don't get me wrong women break out their Han Solo Vests real fucking quick. The average temperature in January for Chicago is 12 degrees to enjoy buying that winter gear. Florida has nearly 300 days of sunshine every year. Chicago is about one third of that. Got to be really careful about that one because generally when people move from Florida, they experience a little bit of depression because of that one. So just prepare yourself for that. Let's talk about your actual job. So you're a teacher in Chicago, you will be paid more than you were in Florida. But the funny thing is even though Chicago spends almost double per student, what Florida does, graduation rates are lower at like every fucking level, especially when you get into high school and college and even more pronounced when we're talking about doctorates and phd Florida manages to spend less and have better outcomes. You're about to have lower air quality, lower quality of water, less access to health care and more expensive health care. The average home you're going to move into is going to be at least twice as old as it was in Florida. So have fun with those repairs. Very likely your commute time is about to double while I wish you the absolute best of luck.

He is in charge of telling the Biden administration what economic decisions that they should make. He also has a Bachelor's degree in fine arts and master's and phd in social work. The guy has no background in economics yet is literally running the White House Council of Economic Advisers. And he just appeared in a new documentary where he was asked a very simple question about America's financial system. You see every single year, the US government, that's a spending budget, it collects taxes in order to pay for that budget. But when the government is running a deficit, which it has done pretty much every year for the past two decades, they cover the shortfalls by selling bonds. Basically io to anybody across the world that is willing to buy them. The government of China owns a significant portion of America's debt. But when deficits are so out of control that even the bonds can't cover up the shortfalls, the Federal Reserve has to step in. They said print a bunch of money out of thin air and use it to buy up the remaining I this is what is known as raising interest rates. But obviously, when the government is printing so much money, it causes the value of our currency to decrease. And that's how you end up with runaway inflation. And so Jared Bernstein, again, the guy in charge of the White House Council of Economic Advisers was asked a very simple question that any person with a brain would ask after hearing the explanation of America's monetary system, why does the United States government choose to borrow money to cover its shortfalls when it can simply just print more of it? And the guy literally cannot answer the question. It's pathetic. But this clip is also going to be referenced in so many history books in the future when talking about the decline of the American Empire here it is, they print the dollars. So why, why does the government even borrow? Well, um the uh so the I mean, again, some of this stuff gets some of the language that the mm some of the language and concepts are just confusing. I mean, the government definitely prints money and it definitely lends that money, which is why the government definitely prints money and then it lends that money by, uh, by selling bonds. Uh, is that what they do? They, they, um, they, yeah, they, they, um, they sell bonds. Yeah, they sell bonds. Right. Since they sell bonds and people buy the bonds and lend them the money. Yeah. So a lot of times, a lot of times, at least to my year with, with mmt the, the language and the concepts can be kind of unnecessarily confusing, but there is no question that the government prints money and that it uses that money to.

I've said before that the dividing line in this country is no longer between right and left. It's between normal and crazy. And the most recent attack on common sense came from President Biden's Department of Education and their total rewrite of title IX when title IX was first written, it was 37 words long. The message was simple. Men and women deserve equal access to higher education in the 52 year since there have been several beneficial additions, guaranteeing equal access to college athletics, establishing due process for harassment cases and so on. However, last month, President Biden released a reinterpretation of title IX that comes in at an insane 459,000 words, let that sink in. It's a document that should scare every woman and frankly every man in America title IX was created to protect women. But Biden's title, IX attempts to erase women completely according to the rule, sex is no longer based on the commonly understood biological differences between men and women. It's based on how a person feels or their gender identity. To put it another way, Biden thinks anybody can be a woman just because they say so as a woman, the mother of our daughter of a daughter and our state's first chief executive to give birth. Thankfully, not while in office, I can't think of anything more offensive or dismissive of the very real, very scientific traits that all women share and that no man does. I find myself asking where are all the so called feminists women fought for so long to have equal access to sports and higher education? Are we really going to throw that all away in the name of political correctness? Walk down any street in Arkansas from Little Rock to mountain home and ask someone the difference between a man and a woman. You will probably get a pretty straightforward answer. But apparently our leaders in Washington can't tell the difference anymore. It would be laughable if it weren't so threatening. That's because the rule doesn't change just language on a paper. It could have a very real impact on Arkansas colleges and universities. If Biden gets his way, female college students will shower and change next to male college students referring to someone using biologically correct pronouns will get you hauled in front of a disciplinary board for harassment and scholarships previously reserved for women will now be open to anyone claiming to be a woman. My message to Joe Biden in the federal government is that we will not comply. Thanks to the hard work of our legislators, Arkansas already has several common sense laws on the books that directly contradict President Biden's new title.

And if President Biden threatens our state with loss of educational funding because we refuse to go along with his election year pandering Arkansas will take the federal government to court. That's because this issue goes far beyond a single locker room or a missed scholarship. The truth is important. Biology is important. The differences between men and women are important.

Every single person in that attendance was Catholic. He spoke about Catholic belief while speaking to Catholic women about Catholic doctrine. So let me say this again real quick before we get started with the rest of this video. If you are not Catholic, stop being a victim for shit that don't apply to you. And also I just want to point out that if you're having sex before marriage, you're not really a Catholic. You're just somebody who goes to mass, get to work on those all fathers maybe throw in a few Hail Marys. Let's talk about what he actually said, spoke against abortion. Let's be real. I'm pro-choice. I would still speak against abortion because even though I don't give a shit and you can go out all the abortions you want. It's also something you shouldn't speak positively about because even if you don't believe you're murdering a kid, it's still a complete and total lack of self responsibility. So that's not something to cheer. Now, next, he spoke against working women and I just got to say that nothing he said was wrong. He pointed out that so many women today are just refusing to submit to a man that they don't want to submit to their man in the home. And he also pointed out that you're going to submit to someone, but instead of submitting to a husband who will love you, protect you, provide for you care for you for the rest of your life. No, you're gonna submit to Bob the middle manager, dickhead at your company and all you get for that is he cuts you a check every two weeks. All of that was true. Ladies you've had rights for about I don't know what 70 years now and you have never been more fucking miserable. And look, I'm not saying you shouldn't have rights. I'm not saying that we all shouldn't be treated equally. But I am gonna say that if someone says something that you were personally insulted by that means it was a little bit true because nobody can actually insult you if you don't already have a complex about what they said, like nobody is gonna tell a bodybuilder they're fat. That bodybuilder is gonna be like you're out of your fucking mind, piss off. But if that bodybuilder had a complex and felt internally obese, it's gonna affect him. So that also applies here where if you happy as an independent woman, if you were happy as a woman going to work every day and doing that for the rest of her life and saying fuck men, then what he said wouldn't have bothered you.

And I care about my community. My dad is a retired navy captain. He served our country honorably. My grandfather is a retired navy captain and I'm doing my part to help our country. The Democrat Party does not put our people first. They put sanctuary cities first. They put illegal aliens first. They tax us, they tax our water. You can't even do laundry and shower on the same day while Nancy Pelosi is getting hundreds of thousands of dollars robbing our pockets. Not doing anything for our people, not passing legislation, passing out pens like their candy",78

Well, it's teed up for a vote and likely it's gonna pass, it's definitely gonna pass the Senate and then after that, it goes to Biden's desk and he already said before that if it hits his desk, he's gonna sign it. So it looks like it's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time until it gets to him, you know, uh, it's procedural basically. So, why is this happening so fast? Well, initially when we talked about it last, it was like, there's all sorts of things about like, oh, maybe there's gonna be a debate in the Senate and all that. But what, um, the house speaker did was he attached the bill to something that has so much bipartisan support, which is funding for all the different things out there for all the, you know, it's funding for Ukraine, funding for Taiwan, funding for Israel, he attached it to that and those three things, you know, bipartisan level in the, in, in Congress there's a lot of support. So when they attach it to it, they're like, oh, ok. Let's just go for it. You know, that's what changed here, you know. So, so if it does reach B's desk, like, what does that mean for everybody? Like, is it gonna be banned immediately? I read the bill. I actually read it. Yeah. Uh Well, I read snippets of it most of it and the way the bill is written is if it passes, they have, um, I think they have nine months to sell. So what the bill says is we're gonna ban this. Now, there's, there's details, I mean, they're gonna have to work that, that part out. I think they're gonna rewrite it, but like the details of it.

And then the president has uh the ability to extend that 90 days. So let's call it within a year, right? But it's a whole lot more complicated than that because what's gonna happen, right? This is a law that's passed right in DC. So basically, it's gonna go through DC by dance is gonna 100% file a lawsuit that it's unconstitutional for whatever reason. They're gonna make up whatever. I think it's gonna fight it. Right. So, you don't think by dance is gonna sell? Well, hold on first. Yeah, I'll get to that. But the key thing that we need to understand is by dance will sue. And because it's in DC, it's gonna go through the DC Court of appeals, it'll make its way to the Supreme Court. Right. And we all know how those things work. It's gonna take some time. So it looks like all in all, maybe at best, the ban will happen in, you know, 18 months, maybe two years at best I think, you know, um will bite dance. Sell yes and no.

He lied, insulted his voters and scared away famous backers. You're not sending weapons to Israel during a war while American hostages, American hostages and hostages from 22 countries are still in that. You're not sending weapons now you dumb. I never ever ever thought I would say this. Ok. But I could promise you this right now. Smoking Joe Biden cadaver, Joe Biden, me, Michael Rapaport. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote and plenty of us also ain't voting for you. You, you Biden's losing the Israel and Hamas vote but the Mideast isn't the top issue for voters. It's the economy stupid instead of empathizing with us. He tried lying his way out of it but he didn't get away with it. This time. Biden falsely claimed that inflation was 9% when he took office. It was 9% when I came to 9%. Inflation was actually 1.4% when Biden was sworn in peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. What's one more lie for a black Puerto Rican truck driving Jewish professor, whose uncle was eaten by cannibals. What is new? Is that? The media called him a liar. Where Biden really shot himself in the foot though is when he told you to shut up and spend more of the money you don't have. There's real pain. I mean, grocery prices are up 30% more than 30% since the beginning of the pandemic and people are spending more on food and groceries than they have at any time. Really in the past 30 years. I mean, that's a real day to day pain that people. No, no, it really is. And it's real. But the fact is that if you take a look at what the people have, they have the money to spend, who has money to spend besides Gold Bar, Bob Fannie Willis who keeps cash in a safe because it's a black thing. People are hurting and life's expensive. Doesn't Joe read the polls? The polling data has been wrong all along. You know how, how many you guys do a poll with CNN? How many folks you have to call to get one response. Joe's fighting with CNN. This can't be good. Biden tells factory workers they're full of ish. Calls a reporter a stupid son of a bitch and calls you crazy if you say groceries are pricey. Joe was supposed to be the genteel granddad who wisely guided us back home. Now he snaps when you point out that he missed the exit. It's always someone else's fault. Even CNN sees it. That sounds like somebody in Washington telling people you're wrong and whatever your party is, voters don't process it that way. They don't like that. Definitely don't like being told they're wrong because it's how they are actually experiencing the economy personally. You don't like people in Washington telling them they're wrong and I think he's making a terrible mistake. You know, it may not be, if he doesn't win this race, it may not be Donald Trump that beats him. It may be his own pride. Biden is an angry recluse obsessed with his legacy. He wants to be remembered like JFK, but he's going down as a mean liar who opened the border botched the Afghan withdrawal and destroyed the dollar. The media is confused because Trump is up in the polls and the Biden trials are backfiring. How hard is it for President Biden to get any attention? Even though he's the only one who's campaigning right now because all the oxygen is being sucked up down in that courtroom so hard because he was, he did something today, right? Biden was someplace he talked about something, right? Yes. Infrastructure. I heard that that happened. Yes, I couldn't tell you where or I couldn't tell you what it is. He was out there somewhere of a dam. Yes and not everybody does. So how can he get the attention? We all struggle with this and how much you should cover these trials? How much we should talk about these trials? There's a lot of things happening in the world who they wanted to arrest this guy for a decade and now that he's in court, they're complaining like a dog chasing a car as soon as they catch it, they don't know what to do. Democrats aren't happy no matter what happens. Has anyone ever noticed that there's just no happiness on the left. They're not happy. They're not happy people. There's a lot of anger, confusion and sadness in the Democrat party. If anyone's read, get it together. You know, they could use a therapist. I'd like to call it a part of this segment therapy with Hillary if I may because she's now going to be because she needs another role therapist. Well, Mika, I'm happy to go to therapy with you any time because clearly the pressure and the stress on our system, our country, our constitution, our future is so intense for those of us who understand what's at stake. If anybody needs therapy. It's Hillary. She never got over 2016 and she's married to Bill. Doctor Clinton prescribed the media with a plan to take down Trump first. You're not calling him a dictator enough. I don't think the press has done enough to basically say, ok, the circus is here. You can watch the circus. But let's tell you what that means. Let's talk to people who have a real understanding of how Dictatorships evolve. Dr Hillary not really known for her bedside manner started insulting her patients. If you're a woman and vote for Trump, you're a tramp. Any woman who has any sense of self respect, autonomy, agency, independence and values, freedom needs to understand. There's only one choice in this election and that's Joe Biden. Only Hillary could figure out a new way to insult half the country. Remember crooked isn't the feminist. She pretends to be. She ran smear campaigns against every woman who had an affair with her husband, even women, her husband allegedly raped. They were called trailer trash. Trump invited them all to the second debate and lined them up at a table and it was a long table. Hillary will never forgive him. Trump, not Bill. She's the one who has no self respect. She's been publicly humiliated, bottled up the humiliation and takes her rage out on Trump in a way. Trump reminds Hillary of her husband and deep down she hates them both. What if Biden doesn't excite female voters and they want to stay home? Doctor Hillary says, shut up and take your medicine. Every one of us has an obligation as a citizen to try to figure out waking up the morning after the election. Do I want to throw my vote away? Do I want to not vote and let somebody who doesn't agree with me or care about me essentially fill that vacuum that I left or do I want to feel like, ok, maybe I'm not ecstatic about the outcome, but I'm safe. What's safe about an open border to proxy wars, record inflation, crime and throwing politicians in prison for winning? Joe is going to have to explain all of that at the debate. Did Joe? Now that you've committed to debate on the ratings challenged Howard Stern show, let's set it up right now. I'm ready to go anywhere that you are. Anytime, anywhere, anyplace. Let's go. Joe, let's debate. Biden says he's game. Biden does show up at the debate. Remember the playbook, Trump's a dictator. Economy is fine. You have money to spend. Migrant crime is a hoax. Republicans open the border and if you vote for Trump, you have no self respect.""",91_mp4_trial_2.json,"Now we know why Biden only does interviews with weather men like Al Roker last night, he talked with CNN and it was a train wreck. He lied, insulted his voters and scared away famous backers. You're not sending weapons to Israel during a war while American hostages, American hostages and hostages from 22 countries are still in that. You're not sending weapons now you dumb. I never ever ever thought I would say this. Ok. But I could promise you this right now. Smoking Joe Biden cadaver, Joe Biden, me, Michael Rapaport. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote and plenty of us also ain't voting for you. You, you Biden's losing the Israel and Hamas vote but the Mideast isn't the top issue for voters. It's the economy stupid instead of empathizing with us. He tried lying his way out of it but he didn't get away with it. This time. Biden falsely claimed that inflation was 9% when he took office. It was 9% when I came to 9%. Inflation was actually 1.4% when Biden was sworn in peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. What's one more lie for a black Puerto Rican truck driving Jewish professor, whose uncle was eaten by cannibals. What is new? Is that? The media called him a liar. Where Biden really shot himself in the foot though is when he told you to shut up and spend more of the money you don't have. There's real pain. I mean, grocery prices are up 30% more than 30% since the beginning of the pandemic and people are spending more on food and groceries than they have at any time. Really in the past 30 years. I mean, that's a real day to day pain that people. No, no, it really is. And it's real. But the fact is that if you take a look at what the people have, they have the money to spend, who has money to spend besides Gold Bar, Bob Fannie Willis who keeps cash in a safe because it's a black thing. People are hurting and life's expensive. Doesn't Joe read the polls? The polling data has been wrong all along. You know how, how many you guys do a poll with CNN? How many folks you have to call to get one response. Joe's fighting with CNN. This can't be good. Biden tells factory workers they're full of ish. Calls a reporter a stupid son of a bitch and calls you crazy if you say groceries are pricey. Joe was supposed to be the genteel granddad who wisely guided us back home. Now he snaps when you point out that he missed the exit. It's always someone else's fault. Even CNN sees it. That sounds like somebody in Washington telling people you're wrong and whatever your party is, voters don't process it that way. They don't like that. Definitely don't like being told they're wrong because it's how they are actually experiencing the economy personally. You don't like people in Washington telling them they're wrong and I think he's making a terrible mistake. You know, it may not be, if he doesn't win this race, it may not be Donald Trump that beats him. It may be his own pride. Biden is an angry recluse obsessed with his legacy. He wants to be remembered like JFK, but he's going down as a mean liar who opened the border botched the Afghan withdrawal and destroyed the dollar.

He did not make 5 billion last year. He is worth 5 billion such a dumb take. Last year, Cuban sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks for $3.5 billion. Back in 2000. He bought the team for $285 million meaning he's getting an 1100% return on his money. So I do understand how taxes work. I do understand that income tax is tax based on your income, but this 3.5 billion is an income. It's a sold asset. So it's a capital gain and here's the tax bracket for long term capital gains. He should have paid 20 percent on the difference between 285 million and 3.5 billion, which after legal fees, which aren't counted against. This is about a $3.2 billion profit. So he should have paid a 20% capital gains tax on $3.2 billion. Just to do the math for you, 20% of $3.2 billion is 640 million. Instead, he only paid $288 million. So he paid less than half of what he should have paid as a long term capital gain.

But anyway, let me explain it to you and let's see if you can keep up user bunch of numbers says you do know how taxes work, right? It is based on how much you make in a year, not on your net worth. He did not make 5 billion last year. He is worth 5 billion such a dumb take. Last year, Cuban sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks for $3.5 billion. Back in 2000. He bought the team for $285 million meaning he's getting an 1100% return on his money. So I do understand how taxes work. I do understand that income tax is tax based on your income, but this 3.5 billion is an income. It's a sold asset. So it's a capital gain and here's the tax bracket for long term capital gains. He should have paid 20 percent on the difference between 285 million and 3.5 billion, which after legal fees, which aren't counted against. This is about a $3.2 billion profit. So he should have paid a 20% capital gains tax on $3.2 billion. Just to do the math for you, 20% of $3.2 billion is 640 million. Instead, he only paid $288 million. So he paid less than half of what he should have paid as a long term capital gain. And if you take into account all his other income from that year, again, just from 2023 he paid an effective tax rate of somewhere between four and 8%. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",99

He made a speech today about the horrific anti Semitism that is happening on our American college campuses. And his speech is the speech that President Biden should have made. But instead, President Biden had a flippant sound bite in passing with a stupid smile on his face. And then in his next opportunity to address the protesters, he decided to leave the press conference. So you tell me who the leader is. The fact that President Biden has not taken to the stage to speak to this country about the state of anti Semitism on campus. He's talking about his plan that he introduced last May. That's done nothing. Come on. He does not care about the Jewish community and do not bring me your politics, watch the videos and you decide you condemn the anti submitted protests on college campuses. I condemn the protest. That's why I set up a program to deal with that. I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the happening on America's college campuses is horrific anti Semitic mobs have taken over leading universities. They call for the annihilation of Israel. They attack Jewish students, they attacked Jewish faculty. This is reminiscent of what happened in German Universities in the 19 thirties. It's unconscionable. It has to be stopped. It has to be condemned and condemned unequivocally, but that's not what happened. The response of several university presidents was shameful. Now, fortunately, state local federal officials, many of them have responded differently But there has to be more, more has to be done. It has to be done. Not only because they attack Israel. That's bad enough. Not only because they want to kill Jews wherever they are, that's bad enough. It's also when you listen to them, it's also because they say not only death to Israel, death to the Jews, but death to America. And this tells us that there is an anti Semitic surge here that has terrible consequences. We see this exponential rise of anti Semitism throughout America and throughout Western societies as Israel tries to defend itself against genocidal terrorists, genocidal terrorists who hide behind civilians. Yet it is Israel that is falsely accused of genocide. Israel that is falsely accused of starvation and all sundry war crimes. It's all one big libel, but that's not new we've seen in history that anti Semitic attacks were always preceded by vilification and slander lies that were cast against the Jewish people that are unbelievable yet people believe them and what is important now, is for all of us, all of us who are interested and cherish our values and our civilization to stand up together. And to say enough is enough, we have to stop anti Semitism because anti Semitism is the canary in the coal mine. It always precedes larger conflagrations that engulf the entire world.

Yesterday, we saw Senate Democrats set fire to the constitution when they refused to allow your impeachment trial. You sir, as the bidder of Joe Biden's policies have set fire to the sovereignty of this nation, to the safety and security of this nation. And a total disregard to the law of the land. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 requires you to maintain operational control of the border and they define operational control as preventing the entry of terrorists, unlawful aliens and narcotics. You know, it doesn't surprise me. Now, when I go back and talk to law enforcement officers in my home state and they tell me that the crime crisis is so bad, the amount of human trafficking, fentaNYL trafficking and the crime related to those is so bad. They tell me that we cannot arrest ourselves out of this. I could triple their officers and it wouldn't be enough to cover the cases. Mr Secretary, how many people died from fentaNYL in this country in the last three years? The last year, Senator, I would be pleased to provide you with that. What would be your guess? Senator, I don't want to guess. But, so you don't know, 250,000 Americans have died from fentaNYL poisoning. And that's on your shoulders. How many people have you paroled in the last three years? Any idea? Senator? I would be pleased as you can. You have, you're in charge of this. You have no idea. Is that 1 million? Is it 2 million? Is it two or three Senator? I would be pleased to how many of those have committed a crime? How many people that have you paroled have committed a crime? Senator, if you would be, if you're pleased to Mister Secretary, do you recall a visit in January? The Eagle Pass? You were in Eagle Pass in January. Do you recall that the precise month? But I made over 20 visits to the border. So forgive me for not remembering the, if you recall being in a, in a room in Eagle Pass, Texas with a large number of border patrol officers. Did you admit the release rate was 85% at that time, as I've testified before, I don't remember the particular exchange to which you refer. What percent would you say? Or what range would you say are released? I don't want to guess. But as I've said before, Senator, I would be pleased to provide you with whatever data. How can you come to this hearing and not know these things? These are things that I know and this is 1 1/100 of my job as well. So listen, you said at that meeting and I got multiple witnesses that 85 that we were releasing 85% of the folks at the border. There's no way possible that you could vet that number of people at a time. 85% of the people coming in illegally breaking our laws. No vetting process, essentially giving them a phone free health care uh and a plane ticket or, or bus ride to, to somewhere. You say you're protecting the nation's sovereignty, but you really facilitated an invasion, sir. This is an invasion. 11 million illegal encounters under your watch. Next question, why are you mass importing tens of thousands of Venezuelans into our country via parole knowing they can't be deported because Venezuela isn't accepting, accepting removal flights. We are not doing that. Senator, you're not paroling tens of thousands of Venezuelans into this country. Senator. Your question was broader than that. The way you framed your question, we are not doing that which you asked, are you importing tens of thousands of Venezuelans into this country? The term importation is incorrect. We have a Cuban Haitian Nicaraguan Venezuelan parole program for those Venezuelans who are paroled and do do not have a basis to remain. So why are you paroling them knowing that they Venezuela won't take return flights. So that is false. We have in fact negotiated in the past removal flights to Venezuela. Those are suspended right now, we also remove Venezuelans to Mexico, for example. So an individual who does so why do you say it's not correct when it's been suspended? That's why Americans don't trust you. That's why Americans don't trust the government anymore is because you're setting it up, you're twisting the truth, giving incomplete answers. This is really a de facto amnesty orchestrated by your administration. There's a reason why Venezuelans won't take them back. Next question. It's my understanding that we have technology deployed that helps track the number of gota ways that have unlawfully crossed our borders and evaded capture by our border patrols. Is that correct? We do have technology that is a force multiplier for our personnel. Ok. Again, under oath today, I'm asking you, is this technology been operational since you took the post? I would like to get back to you if there's any deficit in its operational capability, Senator, I'd be pleased to get back to you on that. Has the system ever gone down under your tenure? I'd be very pleased to provide you with that subsequent to this hearing. How could you not know that? How could you not know what type of, you know, is it been down once or twice? Has it been down for weeks at a time months at a time? Any just range or thought that you could give us? Do you keep track track of track of it in any way shape or form? Senator? We we deploy so many different technologies across the expanse of our department which consists of 268,000 people. If a technology goes down for a short period of time, I may not have visibility of that on the Secretary of the Department. Do you think it's been now for a significant amount of time or an insignificant amount of time? Senator Z previously said I would be pleased to provide you with the information you request. Subsequent to this hearing, I will look into it. How can you keep track of the God of ways if you have no program in place that tells us when this is working or not working? I'm sorry, Senator, can you repeat your question? How can you tell how many gota ways you're reporting if you don't know when this technology is working or not working? In other words, how do we know that that the 2 million known gods is a good number, Senator, the of the individuals on the ground in us, customs and border protection have this ability of the operational capability of the equipment they use, they oversee counting the number of individuals who evade detection to the, but you rely on technology to observe those as well and you don't know if your technology is working or not. Senator, I believe I've answered the question. No, no, you've not. You've said you don't know the answer you've given is you do not know you don't know much of any of the questions, answers to the questions we're asking you. This is why we need an impeachment trial.

Any idea? Senator? I would be pleased as you can. You have, you're in charge of this. You have no idea. Is that 1 million? Is it 2 million? Is it two or three Senator? I would be pleased to how many of those have committed a crime? How many people that have you paroled have committed a crime? Senator, if you would be, if you're pleased to Mister Secretary, do you recall a visit in January? The Eagle Pass? You were in Eagle Pass in January. Do you recall that the precise month? But I made over 20 visits to the border. So forgive me for not remembering the, if you recall being in a, in a room in Eagle Pass, Texas with a large number of border patrol officers. Did you admit the release rate was 85% at that time, as I've testified before, I don't remember the particular exchange to which you refer. What percent would you say? Or what range would you say are released? I don't want to guess. But as I've said before, Senator, I would be pleased to provide you with whatever data. How can you come to this hearing and not know these things? These are things that I know and this is 1 1/100 of my job as well. So listen, you said at that meeting and I got multiple witnesses that 85 that we were releasing 85% of the folks at the border. There's no way possible that you could vet that number of people at a time. 85% of the people coming in illegally breaking our laws. No vetting process, essentially giving them a phone free health care uh and a plane ticket or, or bus ride to, to somewhere. You say you're protecting the nation's sovereignty, but you really facilitated an invasion, sir. This is an invasion. 11 million illegal encounters under your watch. Next question, why are you mass importing tens of thousands of Venezuelans into our country via parole knowing they can't be deported because Venezuela isn't accepting, accepting removal flights. We are not doing that. Senator, you're not paroling tens of thousands of Venezuelans into this country. Senator. Your question was broader than that. The way you framed your question, we are not doing that which you asked, are you importing tens of thousands of Venezuelans into this country? The term importation is incorrect. We have a Cuban Haitian Nicaraguan Venezuelan parole program for those Venezuelans who are paroled and do do not have a basis to remain. So why are you paroling them knowing that they Venezuela won't take return flights. So that is false. We have in fact negotiated in the past removal flights to Venezuela. Those are suspended right now, we also remove Venezuelans to Mexico, for example. So an individual who does so why do you say it's not correct when it's been suspended? That's why Americans don't trust you. That's why Americans don't trust the government anymore is because you're setting it up, you're twisting the truth, giving incomplete answers. This is really a de facto amnesty orchestrated by your administration. There's a reason why Venezuelans won't take them back. Next question. It's my understanding that we have technology deployed that helps track the number of gota ways that have unlawfully crossed our borders and evaded capture by our border patrols. Is that correct? We do have technology that is a force multiplier for our personnel. Ok. Again, under oath today, I'm asking you, is this technology been operational since you took the post? I would like to get back to you if there's any deficit in its operational capability, Senator, I'd be pleased to get back to you on that. Has the system ever gone down under your tenure? I'd be very pleased to provide you with that subsequent to this hearing. How could you not know that? How could you not know what type of, you know, is it been down once or twice? Has it been down for weeks at a time months at a time? Any just range or thought that you could give us? Do you keep track track of track of it in any way shape or form? Senator? We we deploy so many different technologies across the expanse of our department which consists of 268,000 people. If a technology goes down for a short period of time, I may not have visibility of that on the Secretary of the Department. Do you think it's been now for a significant amount of time or an insignificant amount of time? Senator Z previously said I would be pleased to provide you with the information you request. Subsequent to this hearing, I will look into it. How can you keep track of the God of ways if you have no program in place that tells us when this is working or not working? I'm sorry, Senator, can you repeat your question? How can you tell how many gota ways you're reporting if you don't know when this technology is working or not working? In other words, how do we know that that the 2 million known gods is a good number, Senator, the of the individuals on the ground in us, customs and border protection have this ability of the operational capability of the equipment they use, they oversee counting the number of individuals who evade detection to the, but you rely on technology to observe those as well and you don't know if your technology is working or not. Senator, I believe I've answered the question. No, no, you've not. You've said you don't know the answer you've given is you do not know you don't know much of any of the questions, answers to the questions we're asking you. This is why we need an impeachment trial. This is why Americans are demanding an impeachment trial.",119

Some in the next five years, only about 15,000 are gonna graduate high school and only about 1500 of them are actually going to get a college education all because Americans want a way to get rid of the kids. They don't want. Look, let me just say this very clearly. If you are a person who put your kids up for adoption and gave them to the state, you're a shitty person, you're a bad human being. And I think that anyone who does that should be sterilized, we don't need you making any more people.",128

Do you understand that the fed raising interest rates is not going to reduce inflation at all? And I know throughout American history, it has worked before, but that's just not gonna work anymore. Let me explain to you why. So normally what happens when we're seeing over a of inflation is because people have a ton of buying power demand is really high. So the prices are going to continue to rise, therefore spurring on inflation and usually the fed raising the interest rates reduces the demand. It makes it so less people can buy things, therefore less people do buy things and therefore the prices of those things have to come down. But that's not the world we're living in anymore because now that the fed has raised the interest rate, it has lowered the amount of people who are purchasing things, but it has not lowered the amount of things being purchased. All it has done is price the poor in the middle class out of home ownership, right? Because the poor in the middle class have to rely on loans to be able to purchase a home. We don't have 304 100 grand just fucking laying around. So when you raise the interest rate to 7 8% it makes it so that the middle class poor just can't afford a home. But you know who can rich people because rich people don't give a fuck about the interest rate because they're buying these homes with cash. So whereas before you raise the rate, you had 200,000 people competing over 100,000 homes. But when you raise the interest rate, you cut those 200,000 people down to 10,000. And in a normal economy, those 10,000 people would buy their 10,000 homes. Maybe if they were investors, those 10,000 people would buy two homes each and you'd have 20,000 homes off the market and 80,000 still sitting there, thereby bringing inflation down. The FED would lower the interest rate and more people would be able to buy those 80,000 remaining homes. But what's happening is those 10,000 people are each buying 10 houses and they're renting them to the 90,000 people who can't purchase and they're locking these people in a year or two year leases. So that even as homes become available on the market, these people can't get out of their leases and purchase a home. See the FED is acting like we have a normal economy like we did back in the forties or the fifties or the sixties. But that's not our fucking economy today. The fed raising the interest rate is just fucking over the poor and the middle class because like I said before, the rich don't give a fuck about the interest rate. They are just paying cash for shit. And the longer the fed keeps the interest rate high, the longer they price all of us out of the normal market And the harder it becomes for an American family to just get by, let alone gain any ground and make no mistake about this.

And they're gonna say, hey, you Trump this up against them again, it will have no peace when all you gotta do is figure out a way to beat them on the issues, but you haven't been able to do it. Stephen a Smith there again is so powerful. I want to play it again. Uh He's an incredibly powerful voice, not just in the sports, sports world, but culturally, Steven, the, the only thing wrong with it, not wrong, but they can't beat us on policy. They're globalist. We're America first and America's citizens first. Look at any metropolitan area, look at the destruction that's going on. Look at your State City Hall where thousands of illegal alien invaders brought in here by the Biden regime and invited in here by the global elites because they want lower wages. Brother that right there is the ticking time bomb to destroy the African American community and the Hispanic community in this country. Citizens in this country should get a, they should be preferred stockholders in the nation, not common stockholders preferred stockholders. It's not simply America first, it's America citizens first. You've got all the obligations. Hell, we freed half of the world or three quarters of the world between World war one and World War two. And the Cold War, we're the only nation on earth that has cemeteries all over the world. Go to the Philippines, go to Europe, go to Asia. What other nation on earth has its best and brightest, buried on American soil that's been deeded to us, but in foreign countries and foreign lands and for all that, you're at the bottom of the barrel, you come last. It's not just America last, it's American citizens last and they pick up everything. So Steven, they're doing this because they can't beat us on policy. And the more that we're having an awakening of every ethnicity, every race and every class in this country makes us more powerful and them weaker. And that's why they will try more and more desperate measures.",145

Four years ago, we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th president of the United States. I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do and so much more. This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes and we also want them to have luck. A very important word. I'd like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular first lady Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter Ivanka, my son-in-law Jarrett, and to Baron Don Eric Tiffany and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife, Karen and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, the dedicated members of the White House staff and the cabinet and all of the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America. I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people, the United States Secret Service, my family and I will forever be in your debt, my profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House military office, the teams of Marine, one and air force, one, every member of the armed forces and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all I want to thank the American people to serve as your president has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege and that's what it is a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible decent, faithful and peace loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All Americans were horrified by the assault on our capitol political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated now, more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician but as a builder, looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for president because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done, America had given me so much and I wanted to give something back together with millions of hard working patriots across this land. We built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about America first because we all wanted to make America great. Again, we restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn't about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation. And that means the whole nation with the support and prayers of the American people. We achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job killing regulations than any administration had ever done before we fix our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible transpacific partnership and the impossible Paris climate accord renegotiated the one sided South Korea deal and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking US MC A. That's Mexico and Canada, a deal that's worked out very, very well also. And very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing. Billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the US. But the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built without the foundations and footings, it wouldn't have worked out this way. We wouldn't have some of the best numbers we've ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world's number one producer of oil and natural gas. By far powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America's job creation and achieved record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women, almost everyone income. So what ages boomed. The American dream was restored and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle stock market set one record after another with 100 and 48 stock market highs during this short period of time and boosted the retirements and pensions of hard working citizens all across our nation. 401 Ks are at a level they've never been at before. We've never seen numbers like we've seen. And that's before the pandemic and after the pandemic, we rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories and brought back the beautiful phrase made in the USA to make life better for working families. We doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with a terrible pandemic, we produced not one but two vaccines with record breaking speed and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn't be done but we did it. They called it a medical miracle and that's what they're calling it right now, a medical miracle. Another administration would have taken 345, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months, we grieve for every life lost and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic. Once and for all, when the virus took its brutal toll on the world's economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief saved or supported over 50 million jobs and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in health care stood up to big Pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed va choice va accountability right to try and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our constitution as written for years. The American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation's borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in us history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ice officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.""",161_mp4_trial_2.json,"My fellow Americans.

We wouldn't have some of the best numbers we've ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world's number one producer of oil and natural gas. By far powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America's job creation and achieved record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women, almost everyone income. So what ages boomed. The American dream was restored and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle stock market set one record after another with 100 and 48 stock market highs during this short period of time and boosted the retirements and pensions of hard working citizens all across our nation. 401 Ks are at a level they've never been at before. We've never seen numbers like we've seen. And that's before the pandemic and after the pandemic, we rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories and brought back the beautiful phrase made in the USA to make life better for working families. We doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with a terrible pandemic, we produced not one but two vaccines with record breaking speed and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn't be done but we did it. They called it a medical miracle and that's what they're calling it right now, a medical miracle. Another administration would have taken 345, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months, we grieve for every life lost and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic. Once and for all, when the virus took its brutal toll on the world's economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief saved or supported over 50 million jobs and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in health care stood up to big Pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed va choice va accountability right to try and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our constitution as written for years. The American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation's borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in us history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ice officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.",161

So in 1892 we had Benjamin Harrison versus Grover Cleveland. Grover Cleveland served as president prior Benjamin Harrison beat him and the Grover Cleveland ran again. So in 1892 voters were like, ok, which president was better. They chose Grover Cleveland who like Trump won, didn't win and then ran again. So the question is this on three issues that I believe are the most important issues. Who has the better record? Number one on the economy? Where did you feel more comfortable financially, inflation, purchasing power, more stability? Four years of Trump, four years of Biden, over 75% of voters agree. It was Donald Trump. It's not even close second issue. War under Joe Biden. We have new wars in almost every single theater, potential war with Iran. We have issues with China. Obviously, Israel Gaza, Israel Hamas, Ukraine, Russia, Donald Trump was the first American president in 40 years where there were no new wars started. No new wars blessed are the peacemakers. It was stability like we've never seen. In fact, there was an Israel peace deal called the Abraham Accords that Donald Trump brokered. And the final is the border. And just this idea of mass indifference to crime in this country. Crime is like my number one issue. I think that if you allow the small stuff, you get the big stuff is excused. I'm talking about theft arson and of course, entrance into the country, 3.5 million people breaking in and invading the country, the border was the most secure under Donald Trump. So those three things are the things I think you should analyze this election, which president did it better. It takes the guess work out of this election when you go to fill out your ballot. So when you fill your ballot, usually an election is either one of two things. So for example, in the 2008 election, Obama V mccain, it was two visions for the country, but we really don't know how they would be as president in 2012. It was one record versus a vision and a challenge. This is different. This is four years, four years, you judge who did it better? Which president were you richer? Which president were you safer?

But what they've done is bad with all of that being said, we have to unite the country. Phil, the country has to be united. This country is a mess. Every situation needs a hero. What a great opportunity for you to stop this cycle. This vicious cycle of got you got you back, got, you got you back. Every situation needs a hero. What, what a great opportunity to step up and say, you know what? It stops here. It stops with me. I think you'll be impressed. Uh, we have to unite the country. We have to save the country. That's not really saving the country. Uh, there are people that did some bad things. I know who they are and all of that. But, uh, as an example with Hillary Clinton, I'd say I've mentioned her name. Everyone's screaming thousands and thousands. Yeah, I had, we just had 100 and 7000 people show up. And in New Jersey you saw that 25,000 people showed up in the South Bronx, the Bronx. But we had Wildwood New Jersey. 100 and 7000 people is a record. They've never had that. When I mentioned, uh, the name Hillary in the previous to the last election, they said lock her up, lock her up, lock her up. But I would be there and I'm trying to almost quiet him. Now. They were going crazy. How would it be? I win and I lock Hillary Clinton up the president's wife, the former president's wife. I locked her up. And how would it be if I took the Secretary of State? She was Secretary of State and we threw her into a prison someplace. I think it was terrible. And yet now they're trying to do that with me. Think of it. I didn't want to do that. I could have done that pretty easily. She busted up her phones and she busted up her, her laptops and what they did and they put, uh, bleach bit, you know what bleach bit is? It's so expensive. Nobody uses it because it's an acid and it wipes everything out. Could have done it really easy. Don't forget she disobeyed a subpoena from the United States Congress and she broke up all this machinery, all this technology after she got the subpoena, think of it. How would it look if I took the A president of the United States wife and threw her into a prison. I, I hated it because I wanted to bring the country together and I largely did and I brought it together through success because it was the most successful economy in the history of our country. Ok. Now, the difference is they're trying to do it to me and maybe you could feel differently about it, but I don't feel differently. Retribution is gonna be through success. We're gonna make it very successful. We have to bring the country together and you can do that.

This is a race to the bottom and it stops here. It stops. Now, they've made a half a dozen or more major attempts to take you off the playing board and you just said it stops. Now I am going to rise above cycle of ugly. I'm not gonna play this gotcha retribution game. It stops now, I'll forgive. I'll not ever forget, but I am not gonna play this retribution game.

Anything jumped out at you because uh we're talking about um someone that according to the polls uh may very likely resume the presidency of the United States soon, uh which would very likely put him back in a position of being the most powerful man on the planet uh in terms of uh politics, uh military power and control. Um And I think this was an opportunity to have a look at him like we don't often see. Uh So I'm just curious what your takeaways were. Well, for me right off, your relationship was clear that she had a relationship with him that you could talk to him in a way. A lot of people may not be able to and that chemistry matters. You know, young, the famous psychologist once said that no two people are the same after interaction. So we had to watch for that and we could see when he understood that you were not there just to excoriate him and just go after him that he made a good eye contact. We didn't start to pay attention and was like, OK, somebody gets what I'm saying at all. Well, let's take a look. We have a clip of what you're pointing out. You know, it was interesting when you called the other day about doing an interview, a lot of people want to do interviews and I don't just agree to them very easily, but I've always had great respect for you. I watch your show some of the, uh, the real good ones. And, uh, what do you see? So if you see, if you watched him, we typically think when people are having an emotional thought, they look down into their right, their eyes will go down into the right. Think about the last wedding or funeral you went to and that will happen. We see him do that when he's describing the problem. But as soon as he starts saying, somebody of your stature, watch him raise his head and make eye contact and show respect. That's powerful. That means who else is gonna do that? Right? Uh You know, my position just so, you know, going into this kind of interview is, uh I'm not a gotcha interviewer. I've never been a gotcha interviewer. Um I, I want to give people a chance to tell their story, say what they want to say and then ask questions that I think the viewer would want asked. Uh And if they don't answer them, then I'm gonna ask them again. And if they go off on 1/4 of July speech. Then I wanna say, well, that was a nice speech. Now answer my question. Uh I do want my questions answered but I give them a chance to say what they wanna say. But then, and, and I told him at one point, I, I want people to get to know you because you're always campaigning. I don't want you campaigning. I want you to talk to us as a father and a husband and an individual. We wanna know who you are because he's got a speech that he gives a stump speech that he gives us. We've heard that we want to hear some other things and he was willing to do that. Yeah, it showed when he made eye contact with you from that point on, I watched him throughout the entire interview. He cared what you thought. And that's important because it gives a person the opportunity to actually show you the human side as well. And by the way, I have an invitation to uh President Biden uh to do the same thing. Uh uh I have an interview uh scheduled uh with RFK Junior uh for week after next to do the same thing. These are the three people that are involved, uh maybe RFK Junior as a spoiler, but he could swing this whole election one way or the other. So I'm talking to all the candidates that will talk to me. So we'll see how that goes, right. What do you think? Well, I wrote down five things. Phil. Um, he is the toughest guy I have ever seen. I've tried cases of course. And you're exhausted when you try a case as a lawyer. Just imagine if you're sitting there powerless the client, the guy who's got the bull's eye painted on him, your freedom is at stake and you've got no control over what happens in the courtroom. You got a hostile judge. You think the jury is hostile. Your lawyers may or may not be doing what you want them to do and Trump just, and he's getting it from all sides. That was one of five cases. I mean, and he just goes forward full steam ahead. Second, he wears a bull's eye and he gets shot at because he's so formidable. I mean, this guy is really a, a force. I mean, I said to somebody, you know, Phil kind of attended that interview as opposed to conducting it. And that's all you can do with a guy like, like Trump, we just signed professional bull riding here. And so I thought that was a warm up for that. Very good 13. He stays on message. Uh He may wind around but, but he's, it's a familiar message and he's going in the direction that he wants to go trying to pull everybody with him for. He is a damn. The torpedoes full steam ahead speed ahead guy. I mean, nothing gets in his way he's gonna go where he wants to go. Uh You may, may not like where he's going but he, you know where he's going and he's going as hard as he can. And last, this guy wants revenge so bad he can taste it, but he knows better. And Phil, after letting him run as Phil did throughout that interview finally said, I wanna see if I can get you where I want. You, Will you take it back? Will you not uh be a vengeful president if you win? And he said, yes, I'm OK with that. That was really powerful. I hope he can hope he can stick to it. What do you think about the revenge point? You know, uh Doctor Phil, I, I love to watch interviews and I love to watch masterful interviews and I'm always watching how the interviewer is getting to that information. I thought that this was the part of your interview that I just found fascinating and I watched it over and over again. You literally laid out, OK. I am now going to ask you about retribution and revenge. I mean, you just put it out there to him and you, I knew it was important to you because you literally came at it four different times. You kept coming the first time you said, OK, what if, what if you just said enough is enough? We're going to stop it now. And his response was I'm ok with that sometimes I'm sure in certain moments I wouldn't be, you know, and then he kind of went off and then you came in the second time and your second time was every situation needs a hero. You're in a position to be the hero. Do you want to do that? Will you step out? You're like, constantly giving him that opportunity. And this time he kind of dodged and he said, I think you'll be impressed. We need to unite and save the country. And then this the next one you came. I mean, you were obviously prepared as you always are. You said, you know, there's research right now that revenge in this country is an addiction. We are literally feeding off it and you could stop that cycle. And this time he said, well, you know, revenge is a strong word. Maybe we can have revenge through success. And then your last one which I loved was a quote from the Pope that I thought was so good. We are all brothers and sisters. Forgiveness is necessary. Otherwise, what will follow is not justice but revenge. And then you followed up with you don't have time to get even, you only have time to get it right? And he kind of pulled back again. He said, well, it does take time. And then he said, and I give him credit for this, he just said it to you. Sometimes revenge can be justified. So I have to be honest, you know, sometimes it is and then you said, but is the country better or worse for them going after you? And it was very interesting to watch him. It was almost like he was thinking out loud as it was going on. And I wanted to ask you because being in there is so different than just watching it. What were you feeling from him as you were working through this? What were the feelings you were getting from him? And how do you feel? He actually ended up at the end of that? Well, I thought, I thought there was a shift in the interview where he became very reflective where he, you know, when I asked him, why you always talk about what you're doing, why are you doing? It is the cost to your family too much. And at that point, I thought things shifted and he started getting, you know, really honest and, you know, he, he, it, it kind of scared him at one point when he said, hey, I've seen you do this before, you know, it, you break people down, you're not breaking me down. And I said, I don't want to, I'm just asking you the questions and I, and I think when he had to admit the country wasn't better off with them going after him. So it won't be better off with him going after them. And at, at that point, um II I think it landed with him and I think he understood and this is a process. Uh, this is a process. I think he iii, I think it's something that you don't just flip a switch and it changes like that. I think it's a process. It's a matter of, of who's in his ear and, and what they're talking about. But I, I think, I think it was a quantum shift for him to even consider anything other than, you know, full speed ahead. Get the bastards. Yeah. I, I think that shows when he's talking to you because he makes good eye contact and you can see that he has to process and only you were there with all your mirror neurons and not in the room can feel what you're feeling. But what we can see from out here is he makes eye contact and it matters to him what you think and that's important. Yeah. II I thought he made a shift and um and we talked afterwards oo off camera and stuff and uh he hears it. I mean, I, I think he honestly uh hears it. Um And do I think he's cured of his addiction to revenge? Not, no, I don't but I, I think for a, a single sit down, I, I think he made a major shift in his thinking and look, he's not a, he's not a dumb guy.""",206_mp4_trial_2.json,"Interview.

Well, media reports insisted that enthusiasm was building the Biden campaign hit record fundraising numbers in the 24 hours after Biden's remarks, his re election campaign raked in $10 million a record breaking campaign fundraiser. The event pulled in a staggering $25 million even before Thursday's historic hall. Biden had more than twice the cash on hand as Trump. I mean, of course, the labs and influencers were gearing up to take down Trump. Imagine if he actually did win the election. It's over. We're going to have such civil strife. We're going all the things he says because everybody is now on to him where he projects what he's saying, it's what he wants, what he envisions the world to be, which is chaos and craziness. Total craziness. Don't go taxi driver on us there, Bobby. And when it was obvious that the polls really weren't turning around at all, Joe Biden decided to criticize the pollsters. The polling data has been wrong all along. You know, how, how many you guys do a poll at CNN? How many folks you have to call to get one response. But today we learned a few new things about the true state of the Biden campaign. The fact that they decided to abandon the usual debate format that they were demanding and take up Trump's call for earlier debates. Well, that shows that they think they need a game changer and they hope that they will get it with the help of two CNN anchors who we learned today will be the ones who are actually moderating the first.""",209_mp4_trial_2.json,"Biden's S OS to the press.

The event pulled in a staggering $25 million even before Thursday's historic hall. Biden had more than twice the cash on hand as Trump. I mean, of course, the labs and influencers were gearing up to take down Trump. Imagine if he actually did win the election. It's over. We're going to have such civil strife. We're going all the things he says because everybody is now on to him where he projects what he's saying, it's what he wants, what he envisions the world to be, which is chaos and craziness. Total craziness. Don't go taxi driver on us there, Bobby. And when it was obvious that the polls really weren't turning around at all, Joe Biden decided to criticize the pollsters. The polling data has been wrong all along. You know, how, how many you guys do a poll at CNN? How many folks you have to call to get one response. But today we learned a few new things about the true state of the Biden campaign. The fact that they decided to abandon the usual debate format that they were demanding and take up Trump's call for earlier debates. Well, that shows that they think they need a game changer and they hope that they will get it with the help of two CNN anchors who we learned today will be the ones who are actually moderating the first.",209

I get that, I get that the question is whether or not you will provide all of your documents and correspondence. That's the question. I don't need a history lesson. Well, I'm going to say again, we do not control those offices. They make the question is whether you communicate with them, not whether you control them, do you communicate with them? And we provide this, make a request, we'll refer it to our office of legislative, but here's the thing. You come in here and you lodge this attack that it's a conspiracy theory that there is coordinate law against Trump. And then when we say fine, just give us the documents, give us the correspondence and then if that's a conspiracy theory, that will be evident. But when you say, well, we'll take your request and then we'll, we'll sort of work it through the doj's accommodation process. Then you're actually advancing the very dangerous conspiracy theory that you're concerned about. Now, you're, you were a judge once nominated the highest court in our country when you were a judge. I'm just curious. Did you ever make political donations to partisan candidates now? No. And, and you didn't, because that would create the potential appearance, appearance of impropriety. I didn't because there's a federal rule barring federal judges for making contributions, right? But, but under that same theory of attacks on the judicial process, like, shouldn't someone be owed like a jury of their peers and a judge that's non-biased rather than getting a judge from your political opponent's donor file. I'm well aware that you're not asking a hypothetical. You're asking me to comment on a verdict, jury verdict in another jurisdiction which has to be respected. I won't comment on it. That case is still ongoing. The attorney general, I hadn't asked you about the verdict yet. We were getting there. I was, I was talking about the judge. And so, so let me ask you this question about your time. As, as a judge, was there ever a time when you were a judge when you had a family member who was personally profiting off of the notoriety of a case that that was before your court? I'm going to say again that it's very clear you're asking me to comment on a case in another journal. Hold on, hold on, Mister Attorney General. Did you ever have a family member profit off of the notoriety of any case that you settle? Say again, you're asking yes or no. You're asking me to comment on a case currently. Well, it seems you're connecting the dots. Mister Attorney General. I'm just asking you as to a general principle, but you are aware that Judge M's daughter was profiting off of this prosecution. You are aware that that creates the appearance of impropriety. You know, the very reason there's a federal, the rule against judges giving donations is because it is the very attack on the judicial process that we're concerned about. I'm sorry, I don't agree with anything you just said, but I'm not going to comment on it. Ok. You won't comment on it, Mister Attorney General, but you had no problem dispatching Matthew Colangelo whose Matthew Kant is false. I did not dispatch Matthew Colangelo. Matthew Colangelo. Matthew Colangelo became the assistant Attorney general at the very beginning of the bond administration without having been sent. Confirmed goes and gets the senior role at the DOJ. And then after I believe it's Gupta replaces Colangelo. Colangelo makes this remarkable downstream career journey from the US Department of Justice in Washington DC and then pops up in Alvin Bragg's office to go get Trump. And you're saying that's just a, that's just a career choice that was made that has nothing to do with the Law Fair coordinator and saying it's false. I did not dispatch Mister Colangelo anywhere. Well, do you know how he ended up there? I assume he spoke, he applied for a job there and got the job. But see, you know what I tell you, I had nothing to do with it. Well, you might not have had anything to do with it, but we've got this contemporaneous evidence in Mister Palmer's book. So Pomerantz writes this book, which I'm sure you're aware of where he says we put together the legal es to get Trump. We got all these folks together and we assembled them for that purpose. And so when, when we on the judiciary committee think about attacks on the judicial process. Our concern is that you the facts and the law aren't being followed. A target is acquired here, Trump and then you assemble the legal talent from Doj Mister Palmer and you bring everybody in to get it. I really, and meanwhile, the judge is making money on it. The judge is making money on it, or the judge's family is making money on it for stuff that you yourself wouldn't do. You know, no one's going to buy this, no one's going to believe it. It's going to create great disruption. And I am saddened by it because like you, I have given my life to the law.

Well, I'm going to say again, we do not control those offices. They make the question is whether you communicate with them, not whether you control them, do you communicate with them? And we provide this, make a request, we'll refer it to our office of legislative, but here's the thing. You come in here and you lodge this attack that it's a conspiracy theory that there is coordinate law against Trump. And then when we say fine, just give us the documents, give us the correspondence and then if that's a conspiracy theory, that will be evident. But when you say, well, we'll take your request and then we'll, we'll sort of work it through the doj's accommodation process. Then you're actually advancing the very dangerous conspiracy theory that you're concerned about. Now, you're, you were a judge once nominated the highest court in our country when you were a judge. I'm just curious. Did you ever make political donations to partisan candidates now? No. And, and you didn't, because that would create the potential appearance, appearance of impropriety. I didn't because there's a federal rule barring federal judges for making contributions, right? But, but under that same theory of attacks on the judicial process, like, shouldn't someone be owed like a jury of their peers and a judge that's non-biased rather than getting a judge from your political opponent's donor file. I'm well aware that you're not asking a hypothetical. You're asking me to comment on a verdict, jury verdict in another jurisdiction which has to be respected. I won't comment on it. That case is still ongoing. The attorney general, I hadn't asked you about the verdict yet. We were getting there. I was, I was talking about the judge. And so, so let me ask you this question about your time. As, as a judge, was there ever a time when you were a judge when you had a family member who was personally profiting off of the notoriety of a case that that was before your court? I'm going to say again that it's very clear you're asking me to comment on a case in another journal. Hold on, hold on, Mister Attorney General. Did you ever have a family member profit off of the notoriety of any case that you settle? Say again, you're asking yes or no. You're asking me to comment on a case currently. Well, it seems you're connecting the dots. Mister Attorney General. I'm just asking you as to a general principle, but you are aware that Judge M's daughter was profiting off of this prosecution. You are aware that that creates the appearance of impropriety. You know, the very reason there's a federal, the rule against judges giving donations is because it is the very attack on the judicial process that we're concerned about. I'm sorry, I don't agree with anything you just said, but I'm not going to comment on it. Ok. You won't comment on it, Mister Attorney General, but you had no problem dispatching Matthew Colangelo whose Matthew Kant is false. I did not dispatch Matthew Colangelo. Matthew Colangelo. Matthew Colangelo became the assistant Attorney general at the very beginning of the bond administration without having been sent. Confirmed goes and gets the senior role at the DOJ. And then after I believe it's Gupta replaces Colangelo. Colangelo makes this remarkable downstream career journey from the US Department of Justice in Washington DC and then pops up in Alvin Bragg's office to go get Trump. And you're saying that's just a, that's just a career choice that was made that has nothing to do with the Law Fair coordinator and saying it's false. I did not dispatch Mister Colangelo anywhere. Well, do you know how he ended up there? I assume he spoke, he applied for a job there and got the job. But see, you know what I tell you, I had nothing to do with it. Well, you might not have had anything to do with it, but we've got this contemporaneous evidence in Mister Palmer's book. So Pomerantz writes this book, which I'm sure you're aware of where he says we put together the legal es to get Trump. We got all these folks together and we assembled them for that purpose. And so when, when we on the judiciary committee think about attacks on the judicial process. Our concern is that you the facts and the law aren't being followed. A target is acquired here, Trump and then you assemble the legal talent from Doj Mister Palmer and you bring everybody in to get it. I really, and meanwhile, the judge is making money on it. The judge is making money on it, or the judge's family is making money on it for stuff that you yourself wouldn't do. You know, no one's going to buy this, no one's going to believe it. It's going to create great disruption. And I am saddened by it because like you, I have given my life to the law. I care deeply about the law and I think that the law far we've seen against President Trump will do great damage. Well, beyond our time in public service, I see my times expire a back.",221

I didn't have any problem. And all of a sudden within a matter of months, I end up with four cases. Now, of course, it's from the White House and the Department of Justice. They totally control the state case. In fact, I'm not allowed to even be talking about certain aspects of it because I have a gag order. Think of it. I'm the Republican nominee. I was the president and I'm leading the current Democrat by a lot. And I have a gag order from a local judge who was appointed by the Democrat party, a local, a local judge. He's a local person and he is appointed and he put a gag order in. Nobody has ever seen anything like it while you're campaigning while I'm like, you just mentioned a question that I'm not allowed to talk about. Can you imagine? I'm the Republican nominee and I'm not allowed to talk because a local judge from New York appointed by Democrats said I can't talk about it. It's so unfair. And then he gives a jury charge nobody's ever heard of a charge like this. He gave instructions to the jury and by the way, the jury happened to be in a location that was almost no Republican. Do you understand that? Yes, 87 and 13 in the last two elections, Republican. And I know you can't talk about it. I'm not under a gag order. I do know that the number three person in the department of justice took a pay cut and went down in stature to go to a state job and become one of the lead prosecutors in this case. But yet they say, hey, Dr Phil, why are you saying that President Biden needs to stop all of this? It's a state case. That's exactly why I'm saying it don't be naive. People understand that there's a power play going on here controlled by the White House and the DOJ 100% you know, Gerard Baker wrote in Wall Street Journal today and I'm paraphrasing. But he said, what do we say to those people that are rejoicing over reducing law to the status of a weapon in the hands of the dominant political power? Because that's what's happening right now. It's become a weapon and that's not what it's intended for. That's not what we need to be doing. I mean, let's let the people decide these right. That's right. That was a very good statement in the Wall Street Journal. I read that this morning and it's so true. I mean, it's so accurate. They've weaponized to a level, they are trying to affect the election by demeaning hurting in any form. And by the way, I think after the election they'll still, the hatred is great enough that they'll go. But with much less enthusiasm, this is about November 5th, which I think is going to be the most important day in the history of our country.

We all knew it was going to be guilty before it even started, right? And I say this guys as long as the Republicans are playing T ball while the Democrats play fast pitch hardball, this is going to continue to happen.

225.0,https://www.tiktok.com/@outkick/video/7366751798125874478,1,"""I want to talk about the case in New York City right now because I think there are now clear grounds for a mistrial based on Stormy Daniels testimony yesterday. And now the cross examination that is underway and will continue on Thursday. And let me explain why. The only reason why Stormy Daniels should be allowed to testify is to try to go to what was the intent of the $130,000 payment that Michael Cohen made to her. Remember what happened is not actually at issue here. There's no suggestion that any sort of sexual activity to the extent it happened is in question, in any way. The only thing Stormy Daniels can testify to is how she was paid and or how her representative was paid. And maybe if you really want to extend the scope of her testimony to why she believed that testimony, uh why she believed that payment occurred. Although I would argue that her belief as to why the payment occurred is not Jermaine, the only thing that she has to testify about is potentially the intent of Trump in making the payment. And maybe if you really want to argue whether the payment was made at all. Although there's no dispute that I have heard about whether the payment was made. The Sex act that allegedly occurred in 2006 is well beyond the purview of anything that this jury should be hearing. It's salacious, it's scandalous. It is attention grabbing, but it isn't actually pertinent to the case at hand. It's again, the analogy which is an easy one to make because the New York Court of Appeals just tossed it is this is not dissimilar from what happened in the Harvey Weinstein case. And so if you look at this on its face to me, Judge Merchan should have to grant the mistrial because he allowed testimony that was incredibly salacious and incredibly prejudicial and not relevant to the alleged crimes to be heard by the jury. Now, the only defense that I could think he could provide is, oh, well, the defense didn't object enough to the testimony, but the defense objected to Stormy Daniels being allowed to be a witness at all. To me, this is flagrant grounds for a mistrial and I think the New York Court of Appeals is going to grant it. But even judge Merchan far left wing judicial activist that he is, this is not even a close call. Stormy Daniels should not have been allowed to testify about what she testified to. It has no bearing on the case itself and it's incredibly prejudicial. And again, I went back and read the testimony myself. This is a glaring basic level failure by judge merchant and I don't understand how this is not grounds for a mistrial. This should have to be tossed. I bet today now that he's had time to reflect upon it, merchan is starting to recognize how egregious his error is. And if I were the Trump team, I would be slamming this argument like crazy. There has to be a mistrial. Granted this jury heard incredibly prejudicial uh testimony about a sex act that has nothing at all to do with the actual underlying crime. Remember what they're alleging is that this was a bookkeeping misdemeanor that they elevated to a felony. If I'm pretending that I'm the trial judge and I'm trying to be as generous as possible to the prosecution and allow Stormy Daniels to testify. The judge had to give an instruction that there would be no discussion whatsoever about the alleged sexual encounter. Maybe he could even read to the jurors that there's a dispute about whether or not it happened, which clearly Trump denies, she says it did. But the only reason that this is an issue at all is whether or not there was a second crime committed as the prosecution has alleged because there's no dispute that the payment occurred and what the intent of the payment was. And I don't know that uh Stormy Daniels can even speak to the intent of the payment on the behalf of Trump because to my knowledge, she never spoke to Trump. So she's testifying to her impressions of why the payment was made without any tangible direct evidence of why the payment was made. Now, her attorney could testify because he was involved in the negotiations. I believe he already has testified. Michael Cohen could testify. But Stormy Daniels can't because everything she's being told is hearsay. And again, this is very basic stuff. I don't know how skilled merchan is as a judge, maybe he didn't know what the testimony was going to be, but once he allowed it to occur, this is clear grounds for a mistrial. I think this is not going to be very much different than what happened with Harvey Weinstein. I think this whole case is garbage and I think there are many grounds to overturn its very existence purely from a legal perspective. But this feels to me like clear grounds of a mistrial. This thing is falling apart. You've got total misfit loser failures, Stormy Daniels, Bonnie Willis, Fannie Willis, Jack Smith, Alvin Bragg, they're all tripping all over themselves. And for the prosecution, if your goal is to get a conviction, how in the world did they screw this up? So significantly, you don't want to be even close to the line of whether or not there should be a mistrial granted. And again, did you benefit at all from anything that Stormy Daniels said the Stormy Daniels story has been out there for what, like eight years? Everybody's already heard this. I just, I'm stunned by how incompetent this is from the judge and the prosecution. And again, it appears to me that the defense has clearly objected when the judge says you didn't object enough to it. That's not a sign that you did the right thing.

227.0,https://www.tiktok.com/@kentucky_girll_/video/7368520253921414442,1,"""Couple hours in there. First of all, Michael Cohen is the prosecution's star witness. This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer that he only did it once allegedly. And that this was supposed to help Donald Trump. Does any reasonable sensible person, believe anything that Michael Cohen says, I don't think that they should. I actually think that his testimony is going to hurt with any reasonable juror. And hopefully we have a of those I want to say two other things here very quickly. At number one, the thing that the president is prevented from saying, which is a disgrace is that every single person involved in this prosecution is practically a democratic political operative. The judge inside his daughter is making millions of dollars running against Donald Trump, raising money for Donald Trump's political opponents. The number three person in the Department of Justice, Biden's Department Justice left to become a local local prosecutor to go after Donald Trump. And of course, there's Alvin Bragg, a Soros funded prosecutor who promised to go after Donald Trump and now is doing exactly that. Now, look whether you love Donald Trump, whether you like Donald Trump or whether you're a Democrat or don't care about politics. What's going on inside that courtroom is a threat to American democracy. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot have a country where you get to prosecute your political opponents instead of persuading voters. Joe Biden's entire strategy is to try to distract from inflation at home and war overseas with the sham trial. I just want to live in a reasonable country where we try to persuade voters in our politics. We don't try to throw our political opponents in jail. So this is a disgrace and I wanted to be here to show some support from my friend and speaking of my friend, here's Senator Auburn fan here, uh I, I want to reiterate, reiterate the same thing. I, first of all, I'm disappointed in the courtroom. I'm hearing Mr Trump, Mr Trump. He is former president Trump. Give him some respect. I mean, that's what that place is in there. It's no respect. Here's what I'm seeing too. It is depressing. That courtroom is depressing. This is New York City icon of our country and we got a courtroom. That's the most depressing thing I've ever been in mental anguish is trying to be pushed on Republican candidate for the president of the United States this year. That's all this is. He's been here a month. He's been here a month. I am disappointed in looking at the American, supposedly American citizens in that courtroom that the D A comes in and he acts like it is his super bowl and I guess it is to be noticed, but that's what's happening in this country. The Republican candidate for president of the United States is going through mental anguish in a courtroom. That's very depressing, very depressing. I'm glad to stand by President Trump. I'm a friend of his, I'm here more as a friend than a, than a, uh, backing him as candidate as president. I'm sitting there listening to a guy on, on the stand that they had to get out of house arrest because he lied in another court to testify in this court. He's a confected, convicted felon. I mean, this guy, he's up there given an acting scene and all of a sudden he comes out and says, oh, I have recorded President Trump on my telephone. My, this, this guy worked for President Trump. I mean, how can you be convinced by somebody that is a serial liar? I mean, there should be no reason that anybody should listen to this guy. But at the end of the day, the Democrats, the Democrats are trying to beat President Trump in the jury box because they can't beat him at the ballot box. That's end of story. So, uh I'm from the south. I'm here today to represent and to pay my respects to what President Trump is going through. It's a tough time for him. But you saw what happened this weekend. He's got more support than ever because what they're putting him through in that class in that courtroom. Thank you, Congresswoman Nicole Maak. I represent Staten Island in Brooklyn, here in New York City. I'm also here to support President Trump. The case is called the people of the State of New York versus Donald J Trump. But the people of the State of New York know that this is a sham trial. The people of America know that it is a sham trial and is based on a star witness that is a convicted disbarred perjurer who lied to Congress multiple times has admitted to lying before Congress and has been convicted of lying. What I'll say is the people of the State of New York would wish that Alvin Bragg, the district attorney who brought this case would focus on the actual crime that is taking place and plaguing our city. All right, we have drug smugglers that are poisoning our Children. We have illegal immigrant gang members wreaking havoc in our city. We see career criminals being released over and over again and we see a district attorney that reduces or drops charges against the criminals who are plaguing New York. And yet here you have a made up, made up charge for something that's not even within his jurisdiction. That the FEC has said that there is no crime that the DOJ has said there is no crime. You've been listening to congresswoman talk is there talking about crime and her state? She is a district in New York talking about crime, the major issues plaguing the city. But nevertheless, I Braggs decision to go after former President Donald Trump. You also heard from Tommy Tuberville, senator from Alabama who said, look, President Trump has more support than ever. And then notably, you also heard from a name you've heard quite often Senator JD Vance, a top contender for President Trump for his vice presidential pick listed in almost every report for.""",227_mp4_trial_2.json,"Couple hours in there. First of all, Michael Cohen is the prosecution's star witness. This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer that he only did it once allegedly. And that this was supposed to help Donald Trump. Does any reasonable sensible person, believe anything that Michael Cohen says, I don't think that they should. I actually think that his testimony is going to hurt with any reasonable juror. And hopefully we have a of those I want to say two other things here very quickly. At number one, the thing that the president is prevented from saying, which is a disgrace is that every single person involved in this prosecution is practically a democratic political operative. The judge inside his daughter is making millions of dollars running against Donald Trump, raising money for Donald Trump's political opponents. The number three person in the Department of Justice, Biden's Department Justice left to become a local local prosecutor to go after Donald Trump. And of course, there's Alvin Bragg, a Soros funded prosecutor who promised to go after Donald Trump and now is doing exactly that. Now, look whether you love Donald Trump, whether you like Donald Trump or whether you're a Democrat or don't care about politics. What's going on inside that courtroom is a threat to American democracy. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot have a country where you get to prosecute your political opponents instead of persuading voters. Joe Biden's entire strategy is to try to distract from inflation at home and war overseas with the sham trial. I just want to live in a reasonable country where we try to persuade voters in our politics. We don't try to throw our political opponents in jail. So this is a disgrace and I wanted to be here to show some support from my friend and speaking of my friend, here's Senator Auburn fan here, uh I, I want to reiterate, reiterate the same thing. I, first of all, I'm disappointed in the courtroom. I'm hearing Mr Trump, Mr Trump. He is former president Trump. Give him some respect. I mean, that's what that place is in there. It's no respect. Here's what I'm seeing too. It is depressing. That courtroom is depressing. This is New York City icon of our country and we got a courtroom. That's the most depressing thing I've ever been in mental anguish is trying to be pushed on Republican candidate for the president of the United States this year. That's all this is. He's been here a month. He's been here a month. I am disappointed in looking at the American, supposedly American citizens in that courtroom that the D A comes in and he acts like it is his super bowl and I guess it is to be noticed, but that's what's happening in this country. The Republican candidate for president of the United States is going through mental anguish in a courtroom. That's very depressing, very depressing. I'm glad to stand by President Trump. I'm a friend of his, I'm here more as a friend than a, than a, uh, backing him as candidate as president. I'm sitting there listening to a guy on, on the stand that they had to get out of house arrest because he lied in another court to testify in this court. He's a confected, convicted felon. I mean, this guy, he's up there given an acting scene and all of a sudden he comes out and says, oh, I have recorded President Trump on my telephone. My, this, this guy worked for President Trump. I mean, how can you be convinced by somebody that is a serial liar? I mean, there should be no reason that anybody should listen to this guy.

So, as you know, uh late last night, we got back from Michigan, we went to Wisconsin and Michigan yesterday and we had tremendous rallies, sold out rallies, they were packed and the enthusiasm has never been better. So that was a great thing. And it was nice to be able to campaign one day without being in this ridiculous show trial. Biden trial. I call it, but it was quite a day yesterday and many of you were there and I appreciate you being there that the coverage was very fair. The economy, people are asking me about the economy. It's doing terribly and interest rates are obviously not going to be able to be reduced prior to the election because inflation is roaring back. Gasoline is way up. Other things are way up and it's roaring back like they are very surprised. I'm not surprised, but they're surprised. I guess they're surprised. That's what they say anyway. So that's on the economy. It looks pretty bleak for interest rates and I don't think there's any way they can cut them because inflation is very inflation. Remember is a country buster when you have inflation that breaks countries, I mean, literally breaks countries and we can't take that chance. So we'll see what they do. But uh it was sort of announced yesterday that they can't do much with the interest rates have to remain very high. And it's very unfortunate we have low interest rates, they have high interest rates. Uh That's very unfortunate when you compare my economy to this economy, not even a contest. We have the greatest economy in history and now we have sort of a lousy economy, but the problem with the economy is the inflation and anything you made you more than gave back, we call it a 50% tax. It's a biting tax. It's called an inflationary tax and it's about 50% and that's what it is whether you like it or not and it's too bad. We're down at the trial now getting ready to spend another day in the courthouse, which is bogus trial that every leading authority on law should never have been brought, that Alvin Bragg didn't want to bring it until the election happened and that he brought it. You just do know that this case could have been brought eight years ago. It could have been brought eight years ago. Instead, they wait and wait and wait. They know it's not a good case and now it's turned out to be, they've lost every, I mean, they have no case. They have no case, but we have a very conflicted judge unfortunately. And so you never know. But other than that, there's no case and it should have never been brought. But if it was going to be brought, it should have been brought eight years ago. You know, we're talking about 2015, 2000 and 16. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And they wait till I announce and then they start their action and then they wait till prime time.

It was uh very much embedded and just so you understand, this is the radical left, this is a movement from the left, not from the right, the right is not your problem. Despite what like law enforcement likes to say, the FBI director said that he worries about the right. Don't worry about the right, the right is fine. Worry about the left because this is a movement from the left. He's a radical left lunatics and they got to be stopped now because it's going to go on and on and it's gonna get worse and worse and, you know, they take over countries, ok? And we're not letting them take over the USA, we're not letting the radical left morons take over this country. You can't let that happen. And the law enforcement and the people at DOJ, instead of going after Donald Trump, they ought to look at what's happening in their own offices because you're loaded up with radical left people that want this country to fail and we're not going to let this country fail. Thank you very much.""",246_mp4_trial_2.json,"Right. Thank you very much. So, as you know, uh late last night, we got back from Michigan, we went to Wisconsin and Michigan yesterday and we had tremendous rallies, sold out rallies, they were packed and the enthusiasm has never been better. So that was a great thing. And it was nice to be able to campaign one day without being in this ridiculous show trial. Biden trial. I call it, but it was quite a day yesterday and many of you were there and I appreciate you being there that the coverage was very fair. The economy, people are asking me about the economy. It's doing terribly and interest rates are obviously not going to be able to be reduced prior to the election because inflation is roaring back. Gasoline is way up. Other things are way up and it's roaring back like they are very surprised. I'm not surprised, but they're surprised. I guess they're surprised. That's what they say anyway. So that's on the economy. It looks pretty bleak for interest rates and I don't think there's any way they can cut them because inflation is very inflation. Remember is a country buster when you have inflation that breaks countries, I mean, literally breaks countries and we can't take that chance. So we'll see what they do. But uh it was sort of announced yesterday that they can't do much with the interest rates have to remain very high. And it's very unfortunate we have low interest rates, they have high interest rates. Uh That's very unfortunate when you compare my economy to this economy, not even a contest. We have the greatest economy in history and now we have sort of a lousy economy, but the problem with the economy is the inflation and anything you made you more than gave back, we call it a 50% tax. It's a biting tax. It's called an inflationary tax and it's about 50% and that's what it is whether you like it or not and it's too bad. We're down at the trial now getting ready to spend another day in the courthouse, which is bogus trial that every leading authority on law should never have been brought, that Alvin Bragg didn't want to bring it until the election happened and that he brought it. You just do know that this case could have been brought eight years ago. It could have been brought eight years ago. Instead, they wait and wait and wait. They know it's not a good case and now it's turned out to be, they've lost every, I mean, they have no case. They have no case, but we have a very conflicted judge unfortunately. And so you never know. But other than that, there's no case and it should have never been brought. But if it was going to be brought, it should have been brought eight years ago. You know, we're talking about 2015, 2000 and 16. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And they wait till I announce and then they start their action and then they wait till prime time. Super Tuesday, it all started Super Tuesday, the biggest day which we won every single thing. I mean, it Super Tuesday was a big day for me, but that's when it all really came into being and who starts a case right smack in the middle of somebody's elections.

Today, the prosecution tried to paint Cohen as a respectable family man who became a lawyer to please his granny. But the packed courtroom rolled its eyes because everybody knows the real Cohen, a man who lied to that same granny to get ahead. Cohen's been disbarred from practicing law. He went to jail for perjury and tax evasion, lied to banks. He lied to Congress, lied to his wife. Cohen even secretly recorded conversations with Trump when you talk to your lawyer and he secretly tapes your conversations and violates your attorney client privilege. He's not your lawyer. He's a rat. Alvin Bragg's whole case rests on a lying rat. Cohen wants his client sent to jail for following his advice. The man will say anything to convict Trump and rehab his disgraced career because of Cohen's testimony doesn't stick. The S NS are over no more book deals. No more. Netflix Pilots. Tomorrow, the defense will cross examine Cohen and they'll have plenty of fodder. Today. Cohen told the court he paid Stormy Daniels by taking a loan out on his own home. Why didn't he just cut stormy a check? He says he didn't want his wife to find out. Why would Cohen's wife care if Trump was paying to keep a porn star quiet? Was Cohen protecting Trump or himself? Then Cohen punched a hole through the prosecution's case so big brag could fit through it. He testified, he killed the same stormy Daniels story when it was posted on a gossip website in 2011 was Trump running for president in 2011. No, that would be Mitt Romney which proves famous tycoons catch and kill bad press because bad press is bad for business and happy wife. Happy life. This was more personal than political. You protect your family and the brand, whether there's a campaign or not and it was personal for Cohen too. He testified that he was devastated when Trump didn't tap him to be chief of staff. Cohen says he knows he wasn't qualified, but it would have been nice just to be considered. He even thought he was being considered for attorney general. So when Trump told him he wasn't taking him to Washington, Cohen became suicidal and wanted revenge. That's when the feds raided Cohen's office to try to get him to flip, to turn the fan boy into a hand grenade. That's what the feds have done to Trump's inner circle from the Trump rate and flip rate and flip. People do and say anything when facing hard time, Cohen's career in corporate America is done convicting Trump is his only road to more income. So he's angling to be a reality star. My name is Michael Cohen. And for years, I was the personal lawyer for a notoriously bad man. Since then, I've been on a journey of redemption working to set things right now. I'm paying it forward, wielding the tools that I've learned for regular people in trouble. The little guy doesn't usually have access to people with my particular set of skills. So if Trump's acquitted, no Netflix deal for Cohen, so Cohen can prattle on all day about the defendant but the defendant gagged, he can't defend himself or he goes to jail. Not fair. So Trump brought JD Vance to court watch, Michael Cohen is the prosecution's star witness. This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump. Does any reasonable sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says Fox caught up with Cohen on his way home today, Michael, you seemed a bit nervous on the, on the stand today. Were you nervous? Is Trump lying? Did he sleep with Stormy Daniels? What comments do you have for Trump? Alvin Bragg wants you to believe a convicted liar and a porn star who sees ghosts that other star witness Stormy Daniels has sex with men for money on camera. This is a woman who will do anything for money and I mean, anything, her resume is all over the internet. If you don't believe me, no morals, no standards, nothing. And she's so well grounded, she claims she can talk to dead people. The woman testified that she woke up naked in bed and couldn't remember what happened. Implying it was a me too situation but a few years back, that's not what she told Bill Maher. Why did you Donald Trump? Ok. But you say it's not a me too case. It is not a me too case. I mean, I wasn't uh assaulted, I wasn't attacked or raped or coerced or blackmailed. They tried to shove me in the Me too box to further their own agenda. And first of all, I didn't want any part of that because it's not the truth and I'm not a vi I in that regard. That's not what she's saying. Now she's talking about he was bigger and blocking the way. It's all the me too buzzwords. She said there was a power imbalance of power for sure. My hands were shaking so hard. She said she blacked out, blacked out. She's a porn star. A porn star is used to having sex with people. She does not know it. That's the job. Bragg's witnesses, a prostitute and a lawyer, both professions that get paid by the hour and will do anything for money. This is a, he said, she said without a crime. Trump legal team spokeswoman Alina Haba, who's in that very same courtroom every single day said all the reporters care about is sex.

This case doesn't have a dress, an eyewitness. They don't even have a document with Trump's John Hancock.

Even CNN knows it's rigged and costing the Democrats the trials against him. Keep him in the spotlight, infuriate his base who sees him as a martyr and even may serve to make him the object of some sympathy among people in general who believe that his prosecutors are politically motivated. This happens to be true in my opinion. I doubt the New York indictment would have been brought against a defendant whose name was not Donald Trump. Trump's in a win win situation here. If he's found guilty, he appeals. The case is corrupt. He gets the slick Willie bounce if he's acquitted, he beat the corrupt system. He looks invincible and he gets the, I beat the case. Bounce.

I hope you'll subscribe because we're going to cover this case all the way through all the ins and outs. You won't miss out on a single thing today is a perfect example. I'm going to get you up to speed on everything you need to know about this case. The big hitting things by the end of this video, sober view of what kind of a mistrial. Trump's gonna go through starting today. Welcome to Doug in exile. I'm Doug Tole. This is where the happy patriots are. Let's start with that hack. This is Alvin Bragg of him. What he campaigned on in 2020. Listen to this, we know there's a Trump investigation. I have investigated Trump and his Children and held them accountable for their misconduct with the Trump foundation. There were experts on every network, scratching their heads and asking what is he being charged with? The charges are beyond what any other New Yorker has had to face. Here's a piece from just the news with John Solomon. Jury selection is set to begin Monday in the first criminal trial of its former US president, former president Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts related to charges. He paid hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels through a lawyer that's Michael Cohen and covered it up as a legal expense before being elected president. This should be a misdemeanor. This should be a tiny, tiny talk and Trump shouldn't play out to a misdemeanor too. That's another thing they want him to do is admit to guilt by saying it's a misdemeanor. Trump should do no such thing. I also sued the Trump administration more than 100 times for DACA. The travel ban, separation of Children from their families at the border. Alvin Bragg's entire curriculum that is I went after Trump and I let hardened murderers go. Here's Trump on truth social. Today, the radical left democrats are already cheating on the 2024 presidential election by bringing or helping to bring all of these bogus lawsuits against me, thereby forcing me to sit in courthouses and spend money that could be used for campaigning instead of being out in the field, knocking crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of the United States election interference. And that is what this trial is about. Will America believe that Trump is guilty or that the Democrats are guilty for election interference. So I know that work, I know how to follow the facts and hold people in power accountable. I know a lot of judges that would have been not too pleased to receive an indictment like this would have said, you know, what the heck is this? I mean, what are you alleging? That's Turley on Fox News saying judges wouldn't take this? That's the second character is Juan Merchan, corrupt judge, Juan Merchan whose daughter did campaigning campaign work owns a business that helps democrats. So he's compromised. If he was a normal judge, he'd say what is this? But he's not a normal judge. So no matter what happens by the end, I'll prove you, Trump can't get a fair trial because of one merch on. I hope this is set up for an appeal if he loses and I believe Trump will lose. Not because of justice. Here's this close TV, New ABC NBC and CBS newscasts fail to identify Trump prosecutors as Democrats. At least 90% of the time study fines if you need this study to tell you that these, that, to tell you that these uh, prosecutors are Democrats. Well, you're not paying attention and you obviously don't watch this channel, but they should announce every single time who appointed the judge Democrat appointment.""",264_mp4_trial_2.json,"Welcome to the Trump trial day one.

He's spending this week in a courtroom because while liberals claim to hate Vladimir Putin our country and its legal system are very quickly resembling Russia's. The reason Trump is in court is because he was indicted by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin Bragg, who is in the position due to millions of dollars that he received from George Soros. Alvin Bragg indicted Donald Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The business records that Donald Trump supposedly falsified was a payment of $300,000 that he gave to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election, in order to keep her quiet about an alleged affair that they had together. Now hush money payments in of themselves are not illegal, falsifying business records is also a misdemeanor. Bragg also indicted Trump eight years after this occurred. So the statute of limitations has expired. So in order to indict Donald Trump, Alvin Bragg had to elevate this misdemeanor to a felony. And in order to do so, he would have to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels was used in order to conceal a second crime. What exactly is this second crime? Alvin Bragg? Of course, doesn't say, oh, and also if you're an actual criminal in Alvin Bragg's jurisdiction, your felonies get lowered to misdemeanors all the time. In 2022 Alvin Bragg downgraded over half of all felony cases to misdemeanors in his district. If you got arrested for a felony in New York City, there is literally a greater than 50% chance that you didn't go to jail. But if you're Donald Trump, Alvin Bragg will use this ridiculous legal theory in order to indict you, but it doesn't even end there. A judge in this case is a man named Juan Merchant and Shocker. He donated to Joe Biden in 2020. Therefore, having a massive conflict of interest that would cause other judges to themselves but not Juan Merchant. Not only that, but Judge Merchant has a daughter who is the president of a progressive political consulting firm which has been raising money off of the Trump indictment, millions of dollars over a case that her father is presiding over. And when Donald Trump pointed this out on social media, judge Merchant gagged him, threatened to throw him in jail if he kept pointing out how corrupt this whole thing is. On top of it all, they're not even going to let Trump go to his son. Baron's high school graduation as if these people couldn't suck enough. This is what is currently happening in your country. Donald Trump is winning in all of the swing state polls. Joe Biden is a senile old man who was turning to dust every single day.

The first rule obviously being term limits, the people in Congress should be just like the president. They are only allowed to serve two terms. Then they can make way for someone else who has something else to say. Rule number two, congressmen and women are paid the median salary of the state. They represent congressman or woman wants to make more money. They need to take action to raise the median salary of the people in their state. This will immediately guarantee that they understand the people they represent. And I know people are going to say that would be hard to do because they have to go back and forth between Washington and their state. That leads me to rule number three, no more, traveling to Washington and also no overseas travel paid by the taxpayer. Now, how will we accomplish this easy? We all know what fucking zoom is. It is 2024. There is no fucking reason for our representatives to be traveling to Washington. There is no reason they have to meet in the same fucking room just install big ass ipads on each chair and they can talk it out over zoom. It's fucking insane that we are paying for our representatives to travel all the way across the country just to fuck, vote. All we need is big ass ipads, secure push button voting technology and video conferencing technology. Three things we already have as for the overseas travel, there is zero fucking reason for a representative from Idaho to have to go to Paris on official business. They are not foreign dignitaries are not part of some international peace corps. They are representatives of their state so they need to stay in their fucking state. If they want to go overseas on vacation, that's fine. They can pay for it themselves. But there's absolutely no fucking reason taxpayers should be footing the bill for representatives or senators to fly overseas now without them traveling all over the place that's going to free up a lot of time and that will lead to rule number four, which is single issue bills. Only any bill that's submitted to be voted on can only be about one single issue. There is no fucking reason a veterans benefit bill should have anything unrelated to veterans in. It should be putting up one issue at a time, voting on one issue at a time and passing or not passing one bill at a time. Want more money for Ukraine, put up a bill that is just the Ukraine funding don't combine it with some bill giving benefits to old people to try to make everyone feel bad and vote. Yes. If a bill or an issue can't pass on its own merits, then it doesn't need to be passed. And lastly rule number five, any time a member of Congress speaks to the media or the American people, it is automatically assumed that they are under oath and can be charged with perjury for lying to the American people.

That tells me that the fire right now in the Israeli knesset was caused by them that tells me that the Israeli nuclear arms battery arms arsenal nuclear weapons, hundreds of them at Demona in the Negev are very much in the sights of the Lebanese resistance, Hezbollah. If that happens, of course, we are truly in a major all out war in the region. From the Levant to the edge of West Asia, from the Mediterranean to the Gulf. And that war inevitably ineluctably must draw in. The superpowers must draw. In America, must draw in Russia must draw in China. This is the most perilous moment in international affairs ever in the history of humanity. And I lived through the Cuban missile crisis. We are at an inflection point in world affairs. None of these grand geopolitical musics are of course of consequence for the people in Gaza. At least not for the baby I saw in the mouth of a dog this afternoon. That's right. This afternoon, I saw a dog carrying a dead baby in its mouth. The dogs in Gaza are feasting on the bodies of the Children, the women, the fathers and grandfathers of those Children are being eaten by dogs. 65 were murdered yesterday, hundreds more were maimed. There is no hospital at which they can be treated. The borders are entirely sealed. They have no water, no electricity, no food, no medicine, no hospitals and they are jailers. The jailers, the keepers of their concentration camp are conducting mass murder amongst them mass murder most foul and fueled by us. Our governments, our taxes in some cases, our own armed forces in the massacres in Rafah. This week there were Royal Air Force airplanes up in the sky spotting for Netanyahu's mother gang, identifying targets, spying for the Israeli mass murderers. We are deeply complicit in the worst thing that has ever been seen in human history, not the worst thing that has ever happened. There are many things, the partition of India, the Vietnam war, the destruction of Cambodia and many other places, many other things have been worse in quantum but not in consequence. And the difference is this is being seen. We didn't see these other horrors we are watching in real time on our telephones and so are our Children watching the mass murder in Gaza.""",314_mp4_trial_2.json,"A full scale war between Hezbollah and Israel is already underway. Hezbollah is destroying parts of the iron dome. It is raining down missiles at will on parts of the state of Israel as far away as Haifa, the entire northern coast. The Galilee not to mention, of course, the northern Israeli territories, southern Lebanese territories contested for so long between these two parties. The scale of the Israeli response is just now becoming clear, Children, women, civilians are being dragged out of burning buildings out from underneath the rubble.

So a while ago, I posted a video about how the Democrats are going to lose. Jones Biden is going to lose the presidential election because of what he's done with this. Um No hold bar and the G side. Well, he's going to and what I got when I explained it, I said he is going to lose and it's going to be his own fault. It has nothing to do with anybody else but himself and I explained all this and I gave all my reasons and everything else and then what came out of the woodwork? A bunch of Democrats screaming at me saying, oh, you're just gonna enjoy having Trump as a president. Look at your fault this and that. Don't you get it? Here's the thing. People vote on one issue or their president. There are people that do that like someone would only vote for certain people if they, you know, voted a certain way for abortions and nothing else. There are many different reasons. Well, this is gonna be people's big reason to vote against him and it could be enough to swear to give us a Trump vote. That's not their fault. They've asked, they've made their voices heard and they see that their voices mean nothing to this man and nothing to the members of Congress. They're taking away their way of communicating, which is the app we're using right now. They're showing that they don't care and they're just, and destroying lives. They're doing all of this and proving that they do not care about the American people's voices. So by doing so, they are in the book and they're doing it to themselves and they're proving it. They're proving, they're showing us how they really feel about us and only care about their donors, their big donors. And that's why the Democratic Party is going to lose. And it's not the voters fault. It's not, it's the congress people and the president's own fault himself. And if I see anybody else coming in here blaming me for my comments or anything else, look it up yourselves. There are people out there that are going to not vote for him or just vote undecided because of himself. He did this. If he would actually sit there actually turn around and cut ties with them, we would be so much better off and people would actually vote for him, but we know he won't do that. He won't change it over for a new leaf. He won't, he's already made it. He's a proud Z and that's all there is to it. So now this country is going to suffer and we're going to be faced with something else coming this fall and whose fault will that be? It will be? Biden's nobody else's nobody else's. He didn't write the ship. He just kept bringing it straight into that iceberg and it's gonna sink. Not that this country was doing too good on its own anyway. He did this. He is trying to bank on the fact that nobody wants him as, nobody wants Trump as a president. And by his poll numbers, he's proving that he's not doing a very good job at that. So again, people will vote on 11 issue and this is a pretty big issue. So instead of being mad at them, Beman, the guy upstairs who sits there and gives all of our tax dollars over to a shitty country that shouldn't exist and sits there and gets free health care and free education while we sit here and suffer.

And I was looking forward for years to have graduation with his mother and father there and it looks like the judge isn't allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial.

This administration has flowed more than $100 billion into Iran $6 billion in ransom for five Americans a policy which many of us said at the time would only lead to more Americans being taken hostage. And we saw tragically on October 7th that proved exactly right. $10 billion in funds in Iraq that the Biden administration wanted to flow to the Ayatollah. And then over $80 billion in oil. When Joe Biden came into office, the Trump administration with the active support of all of us had vigorously imposed oil sanctions and had cut Iran's oil exports from 1 million barrels a day down to about 300,000. The Iranian economy was in shambles. The Ayatollah was on his knees. Joe Biden came in like the cavalry coming to the rescue and immediately stopped enforcing oil sanctions. And what happened? Iran's oil sales went from 300,000 barrels a day to now more than 2 million barrels a day every one of those barrels is a gift from Joe Biden and the Democrats that is over $80 billion.

And what happened with that $100 billion? Well, 90% of hamas' funding comes from Iran. 90% of Hezbollah's funding comes from Iran. October 7th was in a very real way funded by money given by Joe Biden and the Democrats to Iran and Hamas and Hezbollah. And by the way, Biden also sent hundreds of millions of dollars into Gaza. Even though many of us said if you send it to Gaza, it will go to Hamas and be used for terrorism. They knew that they agreed with that the Biden administration concluded it was quote, highly likely the money would go to Hamas for terrorism. You know what they did.

I'm a mathematician and a physicist here, a double major and I also just won the most prestigious award in the country to pursue research at any institution. I want the National Science Foundation graduate research fellowship. So I think I'm pretty, you know, qualified to say that most of what you're saying is based on like old data. But my question to you and so I was to realize last month but sure, um like for example, gender identity disorder, that's the DS M four, bro, we use the DS M five. Now for psychologists to be able to talk literally cited the DS M five in the speech. And it's called gender dysphoria, which I use throughout the speech, not gender and you can't even make your wife, bro. So what's good? OK. So number one, let me just say the nice thing about having the necessity to have a masculine. We're using a western colonial idea of gender. Then why should it apply if we're using? Because the gender binary as a Western colonial, as a western colonialist framework of gender, you're right. Men and women don't exist in any other culture no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Think about Native American third gender people. I'm not saying that third gender people are just Native American societies, Western African societies like Southern American societies like Mexico. So in other places that are not white dominated and the United States or Europe. And so you said non white people, I'm a mathematician and a physicist. You cannot tell me. So I have a question and also you're not a biologist. So I have a question. I'm a mathematician and a physicist. What in the hell do you know about human biology? And you got your law degree from Harvard, what do you know about biology? You got your law degree? And frankly, and frankly, I would ask another question if your logic is so flawed as a mathematician and a physicist, I would suggest that whichever institution gave you an award revoke it immediately. You know, I have to say that when this guy first started talking and he started to share what his major is in college, the award that he won. I mean, I was pretty excited to uh uh happy for him and excited to hear from him. I thought to really quickly in my head before he started talking because seconds later that all changed. I thought um how, how great it is and what an honor to um for this guy to have the achievement, achievements that he has so young. But oh my God.

At least that's how this kid was acting so rude.""",348_mp4_trial_2.json,"Name is Quentin Merritt. I'm a mathematician and a physicist here, a double major and I also just won the most prestigious award in the country to pursue research at any institution. I want the National Science Foundation graduate research fellowship. So I think I'm pretty, you know, qualified to say that most of what you're saying is based on like old data. But my question to you and so I was to realize last month but sure, um like for example, gender identity disorder, that's the DS M four, bro, we use the DS M five. Now for psychologists to be able to talk literally cited the DS M five in the speech. And it's called gender dysphoria, which I use throughout the speech, not gender and you can't even make your wife, bro. So what's good? OK. So number one, let me just say the nice thing about having the necessity to have a masculine. We're using a western colonial idea of gender. Then why should it apply if we're using? Because the gender binary as a Western colonial, as a western colonialist framework of gender, you're right. Men and women don't exist in any other culture no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Think about Native American third gender people. I'm not saying that third gender people are just Native American societies, Western African societies like Southern American societies like Mexico. So in other places that are not white dominated and the United States or Europe. And so you said non white people, I'm a mathematician and a physicist. You cannot tell me. So I have a question and also you're not a biologist. So I have a question. I'm a mathematician and a physicist. What in the hell do you know about human biology? And you got your law degree from Harvard, what do you know about biology? You got your law degree? And frankly, and frankly, I would ask another question if your logic is so flawed as a mathematician and a physicist, I would suggest that whichever institution gave you an award revoke it immediately. You know, I have to say that when this guy first started talking and he started to share what his major is in college, the award that he won. I mean, I was pretty excited to uh uh happy for him and excited to hear from him. I thought to really quickly in my head before he started talking because seconds later that all changed. I thought um how, how great it is and what an honor to um for this guy to have the achievement, achievements that he has so young. But oh my God. When he starts to talk, it's, you cannot believe that he was given an award for how he is. Even his lack of ability to articulate and inform his questions without getting personal.

He's weak, he's ineffective. He's totally out of it. He can't walk off the stage from a speech and he can't put two sentences together. So how do you do it go after his opponent? This is Biden attacking democracy. A continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time from Russia, Russia, Russia. You know how that ended? No problem to Ukraine. Ukraine. Ukraine impeachment Hoax. Number one, impeachment, Hoax, number two and so many more. The same group of thugs and their fake news allies have been trying to lie, cheat and steal their way back into power. They want to stay in power, they want to get back in power the moment they lost in 2016, it all began. They said we're never gonna let that happen again and I'll tell you what if we lose this election, you may never have another election. These are the Russia hoax people, a hoax that never happened. A Russia investigation that was ridiculous and a waste of $100 million and much more than that. And now we have the same people, the same scum that are weaponizing the entire justice system to persecute us on fake charges. Even while Joe Biden is the most corrupt president in the history of our country and he gets off scot free with the documents, he gets off scot free. There's nobody that ever took documents like his. Now, of course, Hillary Clinton did if you remember bust up all of her phones and acid wash them because she didn't want to give anything after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. But there's nobody like crooked Joe. Joe. What he's done with documents is ridiculous. And unlike me, totally protected by the Presidential Record Act. If you look at the Presidential Records Act and read it carefully, you'll see, I'm totally protected. Nothing happens to crooked Joe, nothing happens to Democrats. The reason the Biden regime is tearing down every law to try and stop me is because I am the one that's fighting to defend you from their entire corrupt system. Remember I'm in the way without me, there's nobody in the way as these sick people have come after me. They're also coming after you. They want to take away your freedom of speech and punish you and your thoughts and political beliefs. They want to flood our country with millions and millions of migrants, which they're doing redistribute your money to illegal aliens and then give them the right to vote. That's what they really want with all these people pouring in. They want to get him the right to vote. They want to ban gas powered automobiles. Go to a ridiculous car that doesn't go very far, doesn't go very long and inflate away your wealth with trillions and trillions of dollars given to their political cronies, which is what they're doing. They want to indoctrinate your Children in our schools and change this country into a nation you no longer even recognize and it's getting very close to that point. They are attacking our democracy in all these ways in a desperate effort to cling to power. We are the ones standing in their way and that is the way it's going to be.

And you know what, whether they try their hardest to take us out or, or try to stop the movement, you will never stop the movement. You wanna know why?

He is God's vessel. He is the David of our time and we ain't going anywhere anytime soon because this is a spiritual battle. It's a spiritual warfare and it's good versus evil.

Things didn't look great for special counsel, Jack Smith and those rooting for holding the president accountable, the Supreme Court's Republican majority seemed ready to hit the pause button on Trump's federal trial and give him a big old immunity pass if he gets re elected. Come November. Chief justice John Roberts even hinted that maybe Trump's got some sort of shield against criminal charges and then Justice Brett Kavanaugh took it up a notch suggesting a prez can't be charged under any federal law when doing official stuff unless the law specifically says. So translation, it's like giving the president a get out of jail free card for pretty much everything they do in office. Justice Samuel Alito even worried about messing up democracy if Trump faced charges for trying to flip the election, talking about setting a dangerous precedent.

Things didn't look great for special counsel, Jack Smith and those rooting for holding the president accountable, the Supreme Court's Republican majority seemed ready to hit the pause button on Trump's federal trial and give him a big old immunity pass if he gets re elected. Come November. Chief justice John Roberts even hinted that maybe Trump's got some sort of shield against criminal charges and then Justice Brett Kavanaugh took it up a notch suggesting a prez can't be charged under any federal law when doing official stuff unless the law specifically says. So translation, it's like giving the president a get out of jail free card for pretty much everything they do in office. Justice Samuel Alito even worried about messing up democracy if Trump faced charges for trying to flip the election, talking about setting a dangerous precedent.

Now, if you haven't heard Prince Harry's visa status in the United States has been under major scrutiny and his immigration documents are actually the subject of a lawsuit. Right now, an organization called the Heritage Foundation filed what's called a Freedom of Information Act request to get the visa application documents for Harry, but the documents weren't released to them. They then filed a lawsuit in federal court requiring that immigration release these documents. And the reason why there's such a concern over his visa status and his visa application is because in his 2023 memoir that he wrote called Spare. He made admissions to past drug use and under us immigration law, noncitizen who make admissions of past drug use or who have been convicted of drug offenses can be inadmissible to the United States and otherwise ineligible for a visa. Now, it's unclear what his actual immigration status is in the United States. I've seen some reports that he is a permanent resident and in other reports. I've seen that he's not and he's here on a non immigrant visa. But the core issue here is that if he failed to disclose his past drug use on his immigrant visa application or non immigrant visa application yet was still granted a visa. This could be problematic as it could be alleged that he committed fraud. And if he did in fact commit visa fraud, this certainly is grounds for the revocation of someone's visa and removal from the United States. And another component of this whole case is that the Heritage Foundation is wondering whether the US government knew about the drug use of Prince Harry yet still issued him a visa. It looks like they're trying to see if he was given special treatment because of his status as a royal. Now, the latest news I have seen is that a judge has been handed did Prince Harry's visa application and there's going to be determination made as to whether this document can be released through the freedom of Information Act request. Now, the outcome of this whole thing could really be one of three things. He either lied on his immigrant visa or non immigrant visa application.

That is the constitutional doctrine that currently governs the separation of powers. What petitioner is asking for is a broad blanket immunity that would protect the president, a former president from any criminal exposure, absent impeachment and conviction, which has never happened in our history. And we submit that is not necessary in order to assure that the president can perform all of the important tasks that the constitution reposes in him over, over in not so distant past, the presidents or certain presidents have engaged in various activity, coups or operations like operation mongoose when I was a teenager and yet there were no prosecutions. Why if, if, what you're saying is right. It would seem that that would have been ripe for criminal prosecution of someone. So, Justice Thomas, I think this is a central question. The reason why there have not been prior criminal prosecutions is that there were not crimes. And I want to explain why there are layers of safeguards that assure that former presidents do not have to lightly assume criminal liability for any of their official acts at the outset. There is a statutory construction principle that is applicable here. It arises when there is a serious constitutional question about applying a criminal statute to the President's acts. It is not. And I'm sure that we will discuss this, that no statute can apply to the president in his official capacity, absent a designation of the president in it. But there is a principle that if there is a serious constitutional question, courts will strive to construe the statute so that it does not apply to the president. In addition to that the president, I think has been mentioned earlier, has access to advice from the attorney general and it would be a due process problem to prosecute a president who received advice from the attorney general that his actions were lawful, absent the kind of collusion or conspiracy that itself represented a criminal violation, which I don't really see as being a realistic option. And then if I could say one more thing because you raised the question about potential overseas taking of life. And the Office of Legal Counsel has addressed this quite specifically, there is a background principle of criminal law called the public authority exception to liability. And it is read into federal law unless Congress takes specific action to oust it, which it never has done as far as I am aware.

I think it's time for a proper introduction. My name is Cole and I studied the brain and human behavior. Yes. The human body can technically survive on Ramen. But here's the thing, you're not getting the nutrition you need to properly have your brain function. Your brain can use the sugar from the starch. But really just to keep things functional if you do that for long enough. So your brain isn't getting the things that it needs to be able to regulate things like dopamine and serotonin. It makes it a little more difficult to be in the cognitive space of your brain to think through situations because your body isn't getting the nutrition it needs. Your brain is closer to survival mode, right? It's already starting to get in the survival mode and it makes it not impossible but much harder to find your pause button and to properly think through a situation, you're much more likely to be very reactive, right? Because your body isn't getting the things that it needs. And so your brain is already defensive not to mention the health implications that come along with that. And long term, you'll actually end up with a higher rate of uninsured individuals going to hospitals and taking up resources. And while we're talking about healthcare again, my friend, you already pay for universal health care. You already do it. You just for some reason have allowed politicians to talk you out of wanting access to it if you want to pay for two insurances and not even get access to one of them. I, I mean, I guess do you, but you already pay for actually really good health care, don't you think you deserve access to it? Why are you letting politicians and private insurance companies talk you into spending more of your hard earned money? It's kind of disappointing to see your response because you said you were in America first that you wanted to take care of the American people. But you don't want to do that. You say that the nut job behind the gun is the problem and not the gun.

I think it's time for a proper introduction. My name is Cole and I studied the brain and human behavior. Yes. The human body can technically survive on Ramen. But here's the thing, you're not getting the nutrition you need to properly have your brain function. Your brain can use the sugar from the starch. But really just to keep things functional if you do that for long enough. So your brain isn't getting the things that it needs to be able to regulate things like dopamine and serotonin. It makes it a little more difficult to be in the cognitive space of your brain to think through situations because your body isn't getting the nutrition it needs. Your brain is closer to survival mode, right? It's already starting to get in the survival mode and it makes it not impossible but much harder to find your pause button and to properly think through a situation, you're much more likely to be very reactive, right? Because your body isn't getting the things that it needs. And so your brain is already defensive not to mention the health implications that come along with that. And long term, you'll actually end up with a higher rate of uninsured individuals going to hospitals and taking up resources. And while we're talking about healthcare again, my friend, you already pay for universal health care. You already do it. You just for some reason have allowed politicians to talk you out of wanting access to it if you want to pay for two insurances and not even get access to one of them. I, I mean, I guess do you, but you already pay for actually really good health care, don't you think you deserve access to it? Why are you letting politicians and private insurance companies talk you into spending more of your hard earned money? It's kind of disappointing to see your response because you said you were in America first that you wanted to take care of the American people. But you don't want to do that.

It's never been easy to abortion care here even before the bans and now having to face patients who need your help knowing you can safely provide it. But being legally prohibited from doing so, feels downright inhumane. Instead most of my days are now spent helping connect patients to care out of state, helping people before or after their abortion, including folks who have self managed their care and referring others to prenatal care because the state has forced them to stay pregnant after Louisiana's abortion ban went into effect. I had the privilege of caring for a patient who traveled over 1300 miles to come see us in New York City. Her pregnancy was highly desired but had severe life threatening complications. As someone who has to refer my patients out of state for basic health care, it is infuriating and painful to witness. There are people who tell me they can't leave their kids to get care. Hundreds or thousands of miles from home.

Her name is KM. I want to turn to her right now. Kara, thank you for joining us. Everyone is so eager to understand what it was like to even be called for jury duty today. When did you realize that this was the Trump trial? So definitely not when I first got the jury letter that that was kind of the standard hope in your mailbox like, oh, I have to take off work in two weeks. Um But so when I texted my mom and said, oh, I got jury duty and she said, starting what day? And I said April 15th tax day and she said, I think that's when the Trump trial starts. Um So I was wondering if I would be on that or on some other case at the same time, you know, in the building because I assume there's a lot more going on. And then yesterday, when I got here and we were put into a jury holding room and it seemed like there were 500 ish people waiting to get put into two separate holding rooms. I had the thought of like, this is probably Trump because I don't think they call this many jurors for anything else. So, so what was everyone doing when they realized, like you at that point that you were likely a part of the Trump jury trial pool of people or people talking amongst themselves was kind of a buzz in the air. You could feel that people were starting to realize it, but people weren't talking amongst themselves nearly as much as I expected. Weirdly enough, I think everyone had a sense of kind of uncertainty over what the protocols were in this situation. And so no one really felt like they should. I'm sure there were some jurors who just didn't know that this was happening right now or didn't realize that this was what they were called for. You could definitely see people kind of looking around like do other people also get the sense that this is not, not really talking about it when you walked in the courtroom and you saw him? Is that when you first learned that? For sure, this is the Trump trial and how did it feel to see him? So in the initial jury holding room, one of the, I guess employees of the court had mentioned something about it being an unusual day. And I, I kind of wondered, like, does that mean we're definitely on this case or just because this case is also in the building. So, yeah, it was when, when we walked into the courtroom and saw him that it was, that I was sure that it was definitely this case. Did he make eye contact with you? Yes. What was that? Like? Odd. Um, it's, you know, it's someone who you've seen as this larger than life public figure for a decade or so at this point and for people who have followed his business career, I'm sure longer than that I didn't. But, and then you get in there and it's, it's fascinating because you get these two very contrasting kind of senses at, at the same time, which is on the one hand, it's, it's this like massive sense of gravitas and importance because you, you know that this is history in the making and whatever the outcome of this is, everything going forward will be affected by it. And at the same time, you walk into the courtroom and you see Trump sitting there, I had never seen him in person before. You see him sitting there and it's like, oh, it's just a guy. Um He's, he's just a dude. Why were you dismissed? Uh I was dismissed because so in the jury questionnaire, uh that you answer the questions too out loud, sorry, this is falling out. Um There is one question at the end that says, is there anything else that might affect your ability to her that you haven't mentioned other than all of the questions that they asked. And I said the nature of my job would make it very difficult for me to be here from 9 to 5 for at least six weeks and probably longer. It's not really something that I can entirely do, you know, by myself in the hours. Five to whenever after being it was that the reason you thought that they dismissed you, was it clear to you why? I believe so? It was, it was right after that question that they tell you why they dismiss you at all. No, but it other jurors that were dismissed due to an answer to a specific question. It was always right after that question where the judge asked the two legal teams if they were objecting to dismissing the juror. So I assume it was not prior questions, but I can't be sure of that.""",473_mp4_trial_2.json,"We have one of the jurors who has now been dismissed. She arrived at jury duty just yesterday was dismissed today. Her name is KM. I want to turn to her right now. Kara, thank you for joining us. Everyone is so eager to understand what it was like to even be called for jury duty today. When did you realize that this was the Trump trial? So definitely not when I first got the jury letter that that was kind of the standard hope in your mailbox like, oh, I have to take off work in two weeks. Um But so when I texted my mom and said, oh, I got jury duty and she said, starting what day? And I said April 15th tax day and she said, I think that's when the Trump trial starts. Um So I was wondering if I would be on that or on some other case at the same time, you know, in the building because I assume there's a lot more going on. And then yesterday, when I got here and we were put into a jury holding room and it seemed like there were 500 ish people waiting to get put into two separate holding rooms. I had the thought of like, this is probably Trump because I don't think they call this many jurors for anything else. So, so what was everyone doing when they realized, like you at that point that you were likely a part of the Trump jury trial pool of people or people talking amongst themselves was kind of a buzz in the air. You could feel that people were starting to realize it, but people weren't talking amongst themselves nearly as much as I expected. Weirdly enough, I think everyone had a sense of kind of uncertainty over what the protocols were in this situation. And so no one really felt like they should. I'm sure there were some jurors who just didn't know that this was happening right now or didn't realize that this was what they were called for. You could definitely see people kind of looking around like do other people also get the sense that this is not, not really talking about it when you walked in the courtroom and you saw him? Is that when you first learned that? For sure, this is the Trump trial and how did it feel to see him? So in the initial jury holding room, one of the, I guess employees of the court had mentioned something about it being an unusual day. And I, I kind of wondered, like, does that mean we're definitely on this case or just because this case is also in the building. So, yeah, it was when, when we walked into the courtroom and saw him that it was, that I was sure that it was definitely this case. Did he make eye contact with you? Yes. What was that? Like? Odd. Um, it's, you know, it's someone who you've seen as this larger than life public figure for a decade or so at this point and for people who have followed his business career, I'm sure longer than that I didn't. But, and then you get in there and it's, it's fascinating because you get these two very contrasting kind of senses at, at the same time, which is on the one hand, it's, it's this like massive sense of gravitas and importance because you, you know that this is history in the making and whatever the outcome of this is, everything going forward will be affected by it. And at the same time, you walk into the courtroom and you see Trump sitting there, I had never seen him in person before. You see him sitting there and it's like, oh, it's just a guy. Um He's, he's just a dude. Why were you dismissed? Uh I was dismissed because so in the jury questionnaire, uh that you answer the questions too out loud, sorry, this is falling out. Um There is one question at the end that says, is there anything else that might affect your ability to her that you haven't mentioned other than all of the questions that they asked. And I said the nature of my job would make it very difficult for me to be here from 9 to 5 for at least six weeks and probably longer. It's not really something that I can entirely do, you know, by myself in the hours. Five to whenever after being it was that the reason you thought that they dismissed you, was it clear to you why? I believe so? It was, it was right after that question that they tell you why they dismiss you at all. No, but it other jurors that were dismissed due to an answer to a specific question.

Number one, despite the judge giving Trump's lawyers over two months to present the DS office with all of the exhibits. They wanted to show the jury in Trump's defense. They still haven't done it yet. And when the D A complained to the judge about this, Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche said your honor. We've been like, really busy. So, and the judge went, ok. Ok. Here's what we're going to do. You got 24 hours to submit these exhibits and whatever is not here in 24 hours is not going to be admitted into trial. And, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know that you guys have been busy. I know you've been filing all these motions to try and delay the trial, even trying to renew or reargue decisions this court has already made. And then there was the three days last week where you dragged the das office into appellate court to try to get the trial delayed. So you've made decisions about how you're gonna use your time and that's fine. That's your decision to make. And my decision to make is you got 24 more hours and Todd was like your honor. We're expected to comply when we're in court all day today and tomorrow. And the judge, it was like, yeah, dude, because on Sunday you sent me three different pretrial motions with exhibits and attachments and they were all filed within 30 minutes of each other. The way you choose to use your time is your business. But my order is clear, you're directed to do it and you're directed to do it immediately. Number two, the D A was like, hey, your honor. Uh Trump has been violating the gaggle left and right. He's been attacking witnesses. In fact, he did it again just now. This fourth tweet he did from inside the courtroom. So could you like hold him in contempt? Make him delete the tweets and find him. So he stops doing it. And Todd was like your honor. My client is simply defending himself. He feels like he's under attack and the judge went, ok. Ok. Time out, we're going to schedule a hearing for this one next week. And Todd, I'm going to give you until Friday to file a motion explaining why I should not hold Mr Trump in contempt and when you respond, please direct me to the part of the original gag order or the subsequent gag order where it says there is an exception to the gag order if Mr Trump feels like he's being attacked because I don't recall inserting that into either gag order number three just before court for the day. Todd went, hey, your honor. Could, uh, my client have next Thursday off? You see the Supreme Court? They're here in oral arguments about how the President should maybe have absolute immunity for anything he's ever done. And, you know, my client would really like to be there for that. And, yeah, I understand that that was announced at the beginning of March and we're only asking for it now, but this is an incredibly unusual situation and I'm not trying to big time you, but, you know, for President and Supreme Court of the United States and really, I don't even think Trump should have to be here at all right now. And the judge was like, you don't. And Todd was like, I mean, not during campaign season, right? And the judge said, yeah, I already ruled on that. Uh, your client is a criminal defendant in the state of New York. He is required by law to be here. He is not required to be at the Supreme Court. And if he is not here, a warrant will be issued for his arrest and then there will be a separate prosecution and punishment for bail jumping regardless of what happens in this trial. And if he should be arrested for any reason that will not delay this trial in any way, he can watch the proceedings on the TV. From a jail cell. Are we clear? So we'll see him here next week? Ok. Ok. Oh, yeah. And bonus funny moment. Apparently Trump fell asleep twice during court today and I don't mean like nodding off a little bit in third period. Algebra. I mean full on head down mouth open rem dream time. Apparently everyone in the courtroom was like, dude, check it out. He's out cold. Who's the low energy sleepy one now, dude. Anyway, day two is on Tuesday and I'm thinking of covering the whole trial.

Yes, they got bench slapped a ton of times by the judge and here are my top three favorite moments. And yes, I am wearing an old timey newsman hat. I thought it was appropriate. Number one, despite the judge giving Trump's lawyers over two months to present the DS office with all of the exhibits. They wanted to show the jury in Trump's defense. They still haven't done it yet. And when the D A complained to the judge about this, Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche said your honor. We've been like, really busy. So, and the judge went, ok. Ok. Here's what we're going to do. You got 24 hours to submit these exhibits and whatever is not here in 24 hours is not going to be admitted into trial. And, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know that you guys have been busy. I know you've been filing all these motions to try and delay the trial, even trying to renew or reargue decisions this court has already made. And then there was the three days last week where you dragged the das office into appellate court to try to get the trial delayed. So you've made decisions about how you're gonna use your time and that's fine. That's your decision to make. And my decision to make is you got 24 more hours and Todd was like your honor. We're expected to comply when we're in court all day today and tomorrow. And the judge, it was like, yeah, dude, because on Sunday you sent me three different pretrial motions with exhibits and attachments and they were all filed within 30 minutes of each other. The way you choose to use your time is your business. But my order is clear, you're directed to do it and you're directed to do it immediately. Number two, the D A was like, hey, your honor. Uh Trump has been violating the gaggle left and right. He's been attacking witnesses. In fact, he did it again just now. This fourth tweet he did from inside the courtroom. So could you like hold him in contempt? Make him delete the tweets and find him. So he stops doing it. And Todd was like your honor. My client is simply defending himself. He feels like he's under attack and the judge went, ok. Ok. Time out, we're going to schedule a hearing for this one next week. And Todd, I'm going to give you until Friday to file a motion explaining why I should not hold Mr Trump in contempt and when you respond, please direct me to the part of the original gag order or the subsequent gag order where it says there is an exception to the gag order if Mr Trump feels like he's being attacked because I don't recall inserting that into either gag order number three just before court for the day.

There was a moment in the afternoon when the defense started their cross examination of Michael Cohen and Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche gets up there and literally the first sentence out of his mouth is Mr Cohen. My name is Todd Blanche. You and I have never met, but apparently, you know me because you called me a crying little shit on Tik Tok and Cohen said, yeah, that sounds like something I would say. Objection sustained strike that from the record strike. All of that from the record. I just need to remind everyone that this is the first ever criminal trial of a former and possibly next us president and the lead defense attorney and the star witness are shouting Buon appetito bitch at each other in their finest New York goumba accents. Also Trump fell asleep again, but I am getting way ahead of myself. Let's go back to the morning session with Cohen resuming his testimony to the da admitting that the invoices he sent Trump were all bogus because he performed no work for them. It was all repayment for the stormy hush money but disguised as a retainer for legal services. In fact, he only did about 10 hours of legal work in 2017 for the Trump family at all. But it was for Melania in a dispute that she had with Madame Tussaud Odes when she didn't like the wax dummy they were making of her. But Cohen said he continued to lie out of loyalty and to protect Trump. He lied to Congress about the Moscow Trump tower project because he had to back up Trump's line that there was no connections between him and Russia and he lied to the Mueller investigation. He lied to the press when the stormy Daniels hush money payout finally came to light and he lied to the FEC when they alleged that it was a violation of campaign finance. But he didn't lie when he told David Pecker not to worry when the FEC started sniffing around the National Enquirer because Jeff Sessions, the attorney general was in Trump's pocket. And Cohen said Trump is the one who told him to say that process, that level of corruption that could have been an impeachable offense in and of itself if only we knew about it at the time. And then the FBI raided Cohen's home, seized his phones, his computers, his tax records. Cohen realized that he was under investigation. He just didn't know which of the illegal things he did for Trump that he was under investigation for. But Trump called Michael Cohen and said, don't worry, I'm the president of the United States. You're going to be ok. That was the last time they spoke directly by the way. And Cohen remained loyal, but there were cracks in that loyalty, especially when Rudy Giuliani sent an attorney named Robert Costa Stello to make contact with Cohen. It was all to set up a back channel to Trump. Let me represent you against this FBI business and any messages you need to get to Trump. You tell me I'll make sure he gets them. And Cohen having a modicum of familiarity with shady lawyer tactics realized that this guy was a spy for Trump so that Trump could have a heads up and cover his own tracks on anything Cohen might say or do in his own defense. And Cohen's wife said we're supposed to your first loyalty, not him. And that's when Cohen decided to plead guilty to a whole bunch of crimes related to the stormy Daniels hush money including tax evasion, lying to a financial institution and illegal campaign finance violations. And he was sentenced to three years in prison. And remember he did 13 months in the big house and was going to be transferred to home confinement because of COVID. But then his book about Trump dropped and Trump had the home release taken away and Cohen was thrown back in the slammer and that did get overturned. Eventually after a federal judge ruled that it was clearly retaliatory cross examination from the defense happened next and Todd Blanche got into it right away. It was like a fricking episode of the Sopranos. You said Trump belongs in an effing cage like an animal. I recall saying that yes, you referred to him as a Cheeto dusted cartoon villain and a dict the douche bag. That sounds like something I said, you said Trump needs to be in handcuffs, do a perp walk and people won't be satisfied until he's in a cell. I don't recall saying that but I wouldn't put it past me. There was a lot of that but there was also more substance to the cross examination. The defense tried to make the case that Cohen has an ax to grind, wants to see Trump in jail and is lying to make that happen. They claim that he's fuzzy on interviews he gave to CNN or the da's office just last year. But that he's crystal clear on conversations he had with Trump from eight years ago and his cooper operation with the da's office. They suggested it was only to get a reduced sentence and he'd say anything to get out of jail. They also suggested that Cohen is motivated by money. What with the two books he's written about Trump and his podcast and his tiktok channel and how he flogs Trump for prison merch and now testifying against Trump. It's all part of his self promotion. But remember they tried this approach against me, Daniels too. He also said that Cohen used to admire Trump a lot and brought up a huge list of all the positive things he said about Trump over the years and said, were you lying then or are you lying? Now, Cohen said that he genuinely believed all those nice things at the time. He said them, but he was also knee deep in the cult of Trump at the time. Overall, they tried to paint the picture that Cohen is nothing more than a jilted ex boyfriend serving his own interests while trying to hurt Trump. But if that's all they got, they're in deep do do because Michael Cohen is the very last witness for the prosecution, they're going to rest their case on Thursday and the court needs to know if the defense has finalized their witness list yet, including Donald Trump because they're up next week and the judge was asking and I am quoting from the court transcript here. So, do you have any indication if he's going to testify? No, no indication? No. So if I understand you correctly, your only witness on defense is maybe one expert, maybe not, or maybe not guys. If you've been following this series, you've seen all the evidence the prosecution has given the jury and the defense has not tried to refuse any of it, not the checks, not the business records and they've offered no alternative theories for the case and now the defense might not call any witnesses. He's 100% gonna get found guilty. Y'all. Court is dark on Wednesday. So we are back on Thursday with the conclusion of Michael Cohen's testimony. Stay tuned.""",504_mp4_trial_2.json,"17 of the Trump hush money trial and holy crap. Today was the straight up funniest day in court.

My name is Todd Blanche. You and I have never met, but apparently, you know me because you called me a crying little shit on Tik Tok and Cohen said, yeah, that sounds like something I would say. Objection sustained strike that from the record strike. All of that from the record. I just need to remind everyone that this is the first ever criminal trial of a former and possibly next us president and the lead defense attorney and the star witness are shouting Buon appetito bitch at each other in their finest New York goumba accents. Also Trump fell asleep again, but I am getting way ahead of myself. Let's go back to the morning session with Cohen resuming his testimony to the da admitting that the invoices he sent Trump were all bogus because he performed no work for them. It was all repayment for the stormy hush money but disguised as a retainer for legal services. In fact, he only did about 10 hours of legal work in 2017 for the Trump family at all. But it was for Melania in a dispute that she had with Madame Tussaud Odes when she didn't like the wax dummy they were making of her. But Cohen said he continued to lie out of loyalty and to protect Trump. He lied to Congress about the Moscow Trump tower project because he had to back up Trump's line that there was no connections between him and Russia and he lied to the Mueller investigation. He lied to the press when the stormy Daniels hush money payout finally came to light and he lied to the FEC when they alleged that it was a violation of campaign finance. But he didn't lie when he told David Pecker not to worry when the FEC started sniffing around the National Enquirer because Jeff Sessions, the attorney general was in Trump's pocket. And Cohen said Trump is the one who told him to say that process, that level of corruption that could have been an impeachable offense in and of itself if only we knew about it at the time. And then the FBI raided Cohen's home, seized his phones, his computers, his tax records. Cohen realized that he was under investigation. He just didn't know which of the illegal things he did for Trump that he was under investigation for. But Trump called Michael Cohen and said, don't worry, I'm the president of the United States. You're going to be ok. That was the last time they spoke directly by the way. And Cohen remained loyal, but there were cracks in that loyalty, especially when Rudy Giuliani sent an attorney named Robert Costa Stello to make contact with Cohen. It was all to set up a back channel to Trump. Let me represent you against this FBI business and any messages you need to get to Trump. You tell me I'll make sure he gets them. And Cohen having a modicum of familiarity with shady lawyer tactics realized that this guy was a spy for Trump so that Trump could have a heads up and cover his own tracks on anything Cohen might say or do in his own defense. And Cohen's wife said we're supposed to your first loyalty, not him. And that's when Cohen decided to plead guilty to a whole bunch of crimes related to the stormy Daniels hush money including tax evasion, lying to a financial institution and illegal campaign finance violations. And he was sentenced to three years in prison. And remember he did 13 months in the big house and was going to be transferred to home confinement because of COVID. But then his book about Trump dropped and Trump had the home release taken away and Cohen was thrown back in the slammer and that did get overturned. Eventually after a federal judge ruled that it was clearly retaliatory cross examination from the defense happened next and Todd Blanche got into it right away. It was like a fricking episode of the Sopranos. You said Trump belongs in an effing cage like an animal. I recall saying that yes, you referred to him as a Cheeto dusted cartoon villain and a dict the douche bag. That sounds like something I said, you said Trump needs to be in handcuffs, do a perp walk and people won't be satisfied until he's in a cell. I don't recall saying that but I wouldn't put it past me. There was a lot of that but there was also more substance to the cross examination. The defense tried to make the case that Cohen has an ax to grind, wants to see Trump in jail and is lying to make that happen. They claim that he's fuzzy on interviews he gave to CNN or the da's office just last year. But that he's crystal clear on conversations he had with Trump from eight years ago and his cooper operation with the da's office. They suggested it was only to get a reduced sentence and he'd say anything to get out of jail. They also suggested that Cohen is motivated by money. What with the two books he's written about Trump and his podcast and his tiktok channel and how he flogs Trump for prison merch and now testifying against Trump. It's all part of his self promotion. But remember they tried this approach against me, Daniels too. He also said that Cohen used to admire Trump a lot and brought up a huge list of all the positive things he said about Trump over the years and said, were you lying then or are you lying? Now, Cohen said that he genuinely believed all those nice things at the time. He said them, but he was also knee deep in the cult of Trump at the time. Overall, they tried to paint the picture that Cohen is nothing more than a jilted ex boyfriend serving his own interests while trying to hurt Trump. But if that's all they got, they're in deep do do because Michael Cohen is the very last witness for the prosecution, they're going to rest their case on Thursday and the court needs to know if the defense has finalized their witness list yet, including Donald Trump because they're up next week and the judge was asking and I am quoting from the court transcript here. So, do you have any indication if he's going to testify? No, no indication? No. So if I understand you correctly, your only witness on defense is maybe one expert, maybe not, or maybe not guys. If you've been following this series, you've seen all the evidence the prosecution has given the jury and the defense has not tried to refuse any of it, not the checks, not the business records and they've offered no alternative theories for the case and now the defense might not call any witnesses. He's 100% gonna get found guilty. Y'all. Court is dark on Wednesday. So we are back on Thursday with the conclusion of Michael Cohen's testimony. Stay tuned.",504

David Pecker, head of the National Enquirer resumed his testimony about buying Karen mcdougal's story of her affair with Trump because it was embarrassing to the Trump campaign. Michael Cohen reassured Pecker that the boss would reimburse him, which was the only reason that Pecker went through with the deal. But he also knew that laying out a big sum of money like this at the request of a candidate without reporting it to the federal election commission was against the law. So they structured the contract with Karen mcdougall in such a way. So as to disguise what the money was really for. That's a really important detail that will come up later with Stormy Daniels. So remember that in fact, the prosecution tried to submit text messages from Dylan Howard, the guy just underneath Pecker that said, hey, at least if Trump wins, I'll get pardoned for electoral fraud. But Trump's lawyers were able to get those text messages excluded because Howard isn't available as a witness and therefore can't be crossed examined. Pecker also testified that before his campaign, Trump would say that stories about his affairs with women might hurt Melania and Ivanka. But during the campaign, he never mentioned them once, which made Pecker think that Trump was more concerned with how it would affect voters. Now, eventually Pecker consulted with election law experts and told Cohen, I've never been comfortable with this. So I'm going to eat the $180,000. I've paid for those two stories and then I'm out, Michael Cohen screamed at him and said, the boss is going to be very, very angry with you. But Pecker held firm and then right after the access, Hollywood tape dropped right before the election, Cohen told Pecker that they wanted him to buy the Stormy Daniels story. Pecker refused and told Cohen that you and Trump should buy it because if it comes out, the boss is going to be very, very angry with you. And a few months later after Trump won the election, the federal elections commission did start snooping around the National Enquirer and Cohen told him that the attorney general was in Trump's pocket so you don't have anything to worry about. But Pecker said he was very, very worried and on the day, the FBI raided Michael Cohen's house. They also came to his house and that's when Pecker said, let's talk immunity in exchange for Cooper operation and that's why he's given up that good, good evidence here. Now, it was the defense's turn to cross examine David Pecker. And after the Smackdown that Todd Blanch got from the judge yesterday it was Emile Bove, who the questioning your magazine pays money for the exclusive rights to celebrity stories, right? And you don't publish all the stories you buy and you've suppressed negative stories about Donald Trump even before he ran for president. Yes. And you've done it for other celebrities too, like Mark Wahlberg or Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago. Tell me, did the FEC ever scrutinize you about Rahm Emanuel? And so it looks like their strategy is to not only make this behavior look normal but also to make the trial look like selective prosecution. Now keep in mind that's not something the jury gets to decide. Also the negative story about Rahm Emanuel was purchased before he announced his mayoral campaign. So it wouldn't have been a campaign finance violation. They also went after Pecker's memory saying, so was that meeting in early August or mid August? And don't worry about it. It was a long time ago, but maybe you don't remember everything that you said on the stand correctly. Pecker said that yes, it was a long time ago. But everything I've said under oath is the truth then moved on to one more bit of business. The prosecution said, hey, your honor. Remember those 10 gag order violations we've accused Trump of, well, there's been four new ones since just yesterday. And the judge says, well, listen, I haven't ruled on this yet, but we're going to set another hearing for May 2nd where Mr Trump's lawyers are going to explain to me exactly why I shouldn't hold him in contempt. And with that court adjourned for the day, we're back for day eight on Friday and I will bring you all that coverage as soon as it happens.

So remember that in fact, the prosecution tried to submit text messages from Dylan Howard, the guy just underneath Pecker that said, hey, at least if Trump wins, I'll get pardoned for electoral fraud. But Trump's lawyers were able to get those text messages excluded because Howard isn't available as a witness and therefore can't be crossed examined. Pecker also testified that before his campaign, Trump would say that stories about his affairs with women might hurt Melania and Ivanka. But during the campaign, he never mentioned them once, which made Pecker think that Trump was more concerned with how it would affect voters. Now, eventually Pecker consulted with election law experts and told Cohen, I've never been comfortable with this. So I'm going to eat the $180,000. I've paid for those two stories and then I'm out, Michael Cohen screamed at him and said, the boss is going to be very, very angry with you. But Pecker held firm and then right after the access, Hollywood tape dropped right before the election, Cohen told Pecker that they wanted him to buy the Stormy Daniels story. Pecker refused and told Cohen that you and Trump should buy it because if it comes out, the boss is going to be very, very angry with you. And a few months later after Trump won the election, the federal elections commission did start snooping around the National Enquirer and Cohen told him that the attorney general was in Trump's pocket so you don't have anything to worry about. But Pecker said he was very, very worried and on the day, the FBI raided Michael Cohen's house. They also came to his house and that's when Pecker said, let's talk immunity in exchange for Cooper operation and that's why he's given up that good, good evidence here. Now, it was the defense's turn to cross examine David Pecker. And after the Smackdown that Todd Blanch got from the judge yesterday it was Emile Bove, who the questioning your magazine pays money for the exclusive rights to celebrity stories, right? And you don't publish all the stories you buy and you've suppressed negative stories about Donald Trump even before he ran for president. Yes. And you've done it for other celebrities too, like Mark Wahlberg or Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago. Tell me, did the FEC ever scrutinize you about Rahm Emanuel? And so it looks like their strategy is to not only make this behavior look normal but also to make the trial look like selective prosecution. Now keep in mind that's not something the jury gets to decide. Also the negative story about Rahm Emanuel was purchased before he announced his mayoral campaign. So it wouldn't have been a campaign finance violation. They also went after Pecker's memory saying, so was that meeting in early August or mid August? And don't worry about it. It was a long time ago, but maybe you don't remember everything that you said on the stand correctly. Pecker said that yes, it was a long time ago. But everything I've said under oath is the truth then moved on to one more bit of business. The prosecution said, hey, your honor. Remember those 10 gag order violations we've accused Trump of, well, there's been four new ones since just yesterday. And the judge says, well, listen, I haven't ruled on this yet, but we're going to set another hearing for May 2nd where Mr Trump's lawyers are going to explain to me exactly why I shouldn't hold him in contempt. And with that court adjourned for the day, we're back for day eight on Friday and I will bring you all that coverage as soon as it happens. Stay tuned.",524

But first, we had to start with the judge telling Donald Trump off again. If you remember when court adjourned yesterday, Trump told a gaggle of reporters that he wants to testify, but he can't because of the conflicted judge's unconstitutional gag order. Well, the first order of business today was Judge Merchant explaining to Donald Trump that while the gag order covers his comments outside the courtroom, he still has all of his fifth amendment rights to testify in his own defense within the courtroom. And he should check with his lawyers if he's confused about that, which is basically a polite way of the judge saying don't lie about this shit because it's not going to get you anywhere and I will embarrass you if you try it. We then continued with Vin Diesel looking defense attorney, Emil Bove, doing an unusually thorough cross examination of Douglas douse the digital forensic analyst for the DS office. It was all very technical and extremely boring. But the defense's strategy here is to try to call into question the authenticity of the evidence one of the ways they tried to do this was to suggest that whoever was on the other end of Michael Cohen's phone messages, be it, Keith Davidson or Donald Trump, that the jury ultimately had to take Michael Cohen's word for it. And then later, they'll try to paint Michael Cohen as a liar with an ax to grind. And if you don't like the way that sounds upon redirect, the prosecution said you did the gold standard of extraction and you didn't see any evidence of tampering or manipulation and any unknown variables the defense suggested are typical and Dow said that's correct. Next up was Georgia Longstreet, another document expert for the das office whose whole job is to catalog all of Trump's social media posts since well ever. And if you're wondering why so many document experts in this trial, it's because Trump's attorneys are refusing to agree to the authenticity of any tweet or TV interview or well, anything so literally every scrap of evidence they're demanding has to go through this extremely tedious process. It is not normal, but then again, nothing about this trial is and then we reached the main event, the people call hope hicks. Yes. The same Hope Hicks who began working for the Trump org in her early twenties, who became White House press secretary for Donald Trump and who got indicted in the Georgia Rico case and C A plea deal. One of Trump's inner circle, she was understandably very nervous on the stand and recounted what it was like being inside the campaign. When that access Hollywood tape dropped, there was a category four hurricane that was about to make landfall on the east coast and it got bumped by the access Hollywood tape. Suffice to say there was a panic inside the campaign. And then Karen mcdougal started talking to the Wall Street Journal about her affair and then of the Stormy Daniel affair started swirling and Trump was very hands on and in charge of all the media responses and was making hope hicks get out there and deny everything. And while the majority of the focus was on how all of this coverage would hurt the Trump campaign. Donald Trump was admittedly worried a bit about what Melania would think. And in fact, the day that the Wall Street Journal story about Karen mcdougal dropped, he made sure that paper did not get delivered to Trump Tower. Yes. Yeah, that's going to work my dude. She'll never find out about it with that one simple trick. But then Hope Hicks recounted a conversation she had with Donald Trump about rumors that Stormy Daniels had been paid off and Trump told her that Cohen did it to protect him against a false allegation and that Cohen did it out of the goodness of his own heart. And that's what hope Hicks said to herself that the man she admired and was defending for months. Now was lying to her damn face. Emil Bove then began his cross examination and almost immediately hope Hicks broke down in tears on the witness stand. And after a short break, they got back into it. And Bove for his part was feather gentle with her, especially compared with how he handled Keith Davidson, say what you want about Todd Blanche Bove is a sharp lawyer and under Bove's questioning hope Hicks said that Michael Cohen was not an official part of the campaign and quite often went rogue much to her frustration. She also agreed that a campaign engaging with the news media was also quite normal. Otherwise she wouldn't have a job side note, engaging is one thing coordinating and conspiring with is another thing entirely. But I digress and finally, Emile Bove asked her if she had anything to do with the Trump or financial records to, she said I do not. And curiously, the defense had no further questions after that, presumably they got everything they wanted from her. And so also did the prosecution because Hope Hicks was dismissed from testimony after that. And on that, we adjourned for the day and for the week, we are back in court on Monday where we will find out if Donald Trump will be found in contempt.

We kicked things off with another gag order hearing about Trump's most recent violations and it went about as well for him as the last one did. Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche who always looks like he's three seconds away from having to use the bathroom complained that everyone in the world gets to say what they want about Trump and yet Trump's hands are tied and the judge said that's because they're not. The criminal defendants. Blanche offered that one of the alleged violations was responding to a Michael Cohen attack where Cohen called Trump von Schutz and pants that was submitted into evidence that is part of the official government record. Now, Von Schutz and pants, but the big concern for the judge was when Trump attacked the jury accusing them of being all Democrats out to get him. Blanche said that was not a violation of the gag order because Trump wasn't singling out any one juror in particular. Rest assured judge merch and shook his head at Blanche incredulously. Look, I am no psychic but if I had to put money on this, I would say that Trump is about to be found in contempt again. However, because these violations came before the judge issued the last contempt order. I don't think jail is going to happen. At least not this time. We then move back to more testimony from Keith Davidson, the lawyer who brokered the hush money deals for Stormy Daniels and Karen mcdougal. The jury saw text messages between Keith Davidson and Dylan Howard from election night where they were saying, oh my God, what have we done? Because clearly they believe their actions helped Trump win. There were messages between Davidson and Michael Cohen. When Karen mcdougall began talking to the Wall Street Journal about her affair and Cohen said the boss isn't going to be happy about this. There was a particularly pathetic conversation after the election where Cohen texted Davidson and said, can you fucking believe that I'm not going to Washington after everything I've done for that fucking guy. I've saved that guy's ass so many times. You know that fucking guy hasn't even paid me the $130,000 back. Yeah, Cohen likes to use the word fucking a lot in text messages. And then when the press did discover that Stormy and Trump did bump up, we got a crash course in how to write a non denial denial letter. For example, Davidson drafted a line where Stormy says I deny the relationship because technically a relationship implies an ongoing situation with multiple encounters and not a single three minute bok in a hotel room while watching Shark Week. But then Stormy Daniels went on, Jimmy Kimmel and implied that yeah, she and Trump did do the nasty. But you know, N Ds and Cohen messaged Davidson about how pissed off he was saying he would sue her and you don't know who you're fucking with. Trump's Nasra vampire looking attorney, Emil Bove was up next with a brutal cross examination of Keith Davidson because at the end of the day, Davidson makes his money negotiating hush money deals against celebrities. And we went through a trip down memory lane of all these salacious tabloid stories that Davidson was involved with Lindsay Lohan, Hulk Hogan, Charlie Sheen and more each time getting payouts from them in exchange for not having certain stories published with Bove, accusing him of walking the line right up to extortion even the time he was part of an FBI investigation that he ultimately wasn't charged in. But implying that, hey, Trump is the real victim here. You know, it got real contentious. And remember the defense's strategy here is to attack the witness's credibility to convince the jury that hey guy is a scumbag and maybe he's lying. And with that, we said goodbye to Keith Davidson and brought in Douglas Dow, a forensic analyst with the Da's office who explained all the technical details of extracting information from Michael Cohen's iphones and assuring its authenticity all the way to trial. And you can just imagine how exciting that all was for Donald Trump who nodded off again, except Trump claims he didn't. And during the lunch break even tweeted out. Contrary to the fake news media, I don't fall asleep during the crooked das witch hunt, especially not today. I simply close my beautiful blue eyes sometimes listen intently and take it all in the jury. Then got to hear recordings from Michael Cohen's iphone where Cohen tells Trump that he needs to open an account to pay money for their friend, David, a reference David Denison, the pseudonym Trump used on the Stormy Daniels hush Money contract. Cohen also added that he's spoken to Allen Weissberg about how to set up these shell companies to disguise it. All this is all done to show that Trump was intimately involved with his whole arrangement despite his continued denials, Emile Bove then began his cross examination trying to probe if maybe the evidence got corrupted or even falsified on the way to trial. But Dow shut that down and said there was a digital fingerprint. A man come on and by that time it was 430. And so we adjourned for the day. And Trump quickly went outside the courtroom and told the assembled reporters that hey, while he wants to testify, he can't anymore because of that pesky gag order, which is obviously not true, which means either Trump has been horribly misinformed by his lawyers or they have successfully convinced him that if he does take the witness stand, he will almost certainly incriminate himself and go to jail. But either way, I hope we begin the next day of court with Judge Merchant taking Trump aside and explaining to him his constitutional fifth amendment rights to either testify or not testify in his own defense, regardless of the gag order.

It's not like they're being thrown out. I mean, this is something that is, is starting to pick up steam. They're gravitating toward it. By the way, Donald is not gonna like this, this is going to cause him serious trauma. He's gonna stop showing up to his rallies and I'm here for it, to be honest with you. If anybody deserves this, it is Donald Trump",544

First of all, there is the eye closing, which he now does about 10 minutes into the proceeding. And I think he's doing that to try to prove to us that he's actually not sleeping because it's only 9:40 a.m. But the eyes are closed for extended periods of time, the head starts to tilt and then when he's not doing that, I actually saw him looking at photographs and I could see over his shoulder of what appeared to be crowds, possibly, possibly photographs of his rally this weekend stuff, completely unrelated to this case. And, you know, the jury doesn't have a particularly easy view of Donald Trump in this crowded courtroom and they pretty much never look at him, which is unusual. Most of the time jurors have a very clear view of defendants and they have, they checked them out from time to time during various points in the testimony. But if the jurors could really see how removed from this proceeding, Donald Trump actually at least tries to be when he's sitting there at the defense table, I think it's a liberate act. He wants to show that what's happening on that witness stand is not important to him, but he's just the strangest defendant presence you could possibly ask for. And that's before you even get to his previous occupation as President of the United States.",547

But really today was all about jury selection. The court needs to find 12 people plus six alternates who can render a fair and impartial verdict in this case. And with 500 people in the jury pool, how hard could that be? Apparently very because of the 1st 96 people brought into the court. Over half were dismissed right away when they admitted they had strong opinions about Trump and couldn't be impartial. Others still couldn't spare these 6 to 8 weeks, the trial might take and only about 25% made it to the actual juror interviews where lawyers from both sides were able to ask them questions about where they got their news from, what books they read, what organizations they supported, etc as well as combing through the last nine years of their social media posts. But mostly there were two big questions. They needed answers to the das office wanted to know if the jurors had an issue with the theory of accessorial liability. The idea of if you ask someone to do a dirty deed for you? Are you just as guilty of that dirty deed as if you did it yourself? And Trump's lawyers meanwhile, wanted to know. So do you like President Trump or not? Don't worry Judge Merchant was all over that and told Trump's lawyers. Come on, dude, you can't be asking that for his part. Trump was very hands on and wanted to be part of all the sidebars during the jury interviews, which of course led him to getting in trouble with the court. It happened when one woman was being grilled over a Facebook video she made of New Yorkers honking their horns when Biden won the election. And she said it was because it reminded her of when they did it for health care workers during COVID. And it didn't mean that she couldn't be impartial. Trump gestured and commented in her direction, his displeasure with her answer which drew a swift rebuke from judge merchant who warned Trump that he would not tolerate any jury intimidation in his court and then told Trump's lawyers they needed to control their client. Now, eventually Trump either bored or fed up, being subjected to an endless string of online memes at his expense and decided he didn't want to be part of those sidebars anymore. Either that or he just wanted another nap. Some more fun bits from the jury interviews. One potential juror said he works in real estate and So he knows a lot of people who know Donald Trump. Another said he was already on a jury against Trump for a civil lawsuit years ago. But the wildest to me was a woman who didn't like the things Trump said, but respected him for speaking his mind and that this was the first time she had heard he was in legal trouble. She was completely unaware of his four indictments and 91 felonies, she made it on to the jury by the way. And at the end of the day, seven people wound up getting seated, three women and four men, two of which are lawyers that leaves 11 more to be seated which resumes on Thursday because there is no court on Wednesday. One more interesting tidbit. About 40% of the prospective jurors said they got their news from tiktok. They could even be watching this video right now. That is crazy to me.
